   To recap the process needed to use a library:
  </p>
  <p>
   Once per library:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    Acquire the library.  Download it from the website or via a package manager.
   </li>
   <li>
    Install the library.  Unzip it to a directory or install it via a package manager.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Once per project:
  </p>
  <ol start="3">
   <li>
    Tell the compiler where to look for the header file(s) for the library.
   </li>
   <li>
    Tell the linker where to look for the precompiled library file(s) for the library (if there are any).
   </li>
   <li>
    Tell the linker which static or import precompiled library files to link (if there are any).
   </li>
   <li>
    #include the library’s header file(s) in your program.
   </li>
   <li>
    Make sure the program know where to find any dynamic libraries being used.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Steps 1 and 2 -- Acquire and install library
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Download and install the library to your hard disk.  See the tutorial on
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/">
    static and dynamic libraries
   </a>
   for more information about this step.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Steps 3 and 4 -- Tell the compiler where to find headers and library files
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A) Go to the Project menu and pick Project -&gt; Properties (it should be at the bottom)
  </p>
  <p>
   B) Under the “Configuration” dropdown, make sure that “All configurations” is selected.
  </p>
  <p>
   C) In the left window pane, select “Configuration Properties” -&gt; “VC++ Directories”.
  </p>
  <p>
   D) On the “Include Directories” line, add the path to the .h files for the library (make sure this is separated from previous entries by a semicolon).
  </p>
  <p>
   E) On the “Library Directories”, add the path to the library (.lib) files for the library (if there are any).
  </p>
  <p>
   F) Click “OK”.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Step 5 -- Tell the linker which libraries your program is using
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   For step 5, we need to add the library (.lib) files from the library to our project (if there are any -- if not, you can skip this step).  We do this on an individual project basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   A) Go to the Project menu and pick Project -&gt; Properties (it should be at the bottom)
  </p>
  <p>
   B) Under the “Configuration” dropdown, make sure that “All configurations” is selected.
  </p>
  <p>
   C) In the left window pane, select “Configuration Properties” -&gt; “Linker” -&gt; “Input”.
  </p>
  <p>
   D) Add the name of your .lib file to the list of “Additional Dependencies” (separated from previous entries by a semicolon)
  </p>
  <p>
   E) Click “OK”.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Steps 6 and 7 -- #include header files and make sure project can find DLLs
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Simply #include the header file(s) from the library in your project as per usual.
  </p>

   The vcpkg package manager
  </p>
  <p>
   vcpkg is a Microsoft-developed package manager that makes it easier to download, install, manage, and use C++ libraries.  It integrates with Visual Studio.  See
