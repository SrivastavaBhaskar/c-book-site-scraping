   0.12 — Configuring your compiler: Choosing a language standard

  <p>
   With many different versions of C++ available (C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, etc…) how does your compiler know which one to use? Generally, a compiler will pick a standard to default to. Typically the default is
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   the most recent language standard -- many default to C++14, which is missing many of the latest and greatest features.
   <p>
    If you wish to use a different language standard (and you probably will), you’ll have to configure your IDE/compiler to do so.
    <p>
     The conventional names for language standards (e.g. C++20) are based on the year the language standard was published (or expected to be published). Because the year of publication is not actually known until it is close, language standards that are early in development sometimes use a development name instead. For example, C++20 is also known as C++2a.

      Which language standard should you choose?
      <p>
       In professional environments, it’s common to choose a language standard that is one or two versions back from the latest finalized standard (e.g. if C++20 were the latest finalized version, that means C++14 or C++17). This is typically done to ensure the compiler makers have had a chance to resolve defects, and so that best practices for new features are well understood. Where relevant, this also helps ensure better cross-platform compatibility, as compilers on some platforms may not provide full support for newer language standards immediately.
       <p>
        For personal projects and while learning, we recommend choosing the latest finalized standard, as there is little downside to doing so.
        <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground">
         <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
          Tip
          <p>
           Many compilers offer “experimental” or “preview” support for features from the upcoming non-finalized language standards. Your IDE may offer this as an option in the settings where you configure your language standard, or you may be able to enable it manually using the upcoming language standard’s conventional name or development name.
           <p>
            Support for features from non-finalized language standards will be incomplete and possibly buggy.

           This website currently targets the C++17 standard, meaning our lessons and examples assume your compiler is C++17 capable. Some C++20 and C++23 content is available for those with compatible compilers.
           <p>
            To take full advantage of all the lesson content, we recommend using the latest language standard your compiler supports.
            <p>
             If your compiler doesn’t support C++17, we recommend upgrading to one that does, or consider using an online compiler that supports C++17 or newer while learning.

          <p>
           To use these newer features, you’ll need to enable a newer language standard. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to do this globally -- you must do so on a project-by-project basis.

               Setting a language standard in Code::Blocks
               <p>
                Code::Blocks may default to a pre-C++11 language standard. You’ll definitely want to check and ensure a more modern language standard is enabled.
                <p>
                 The good news is that Code::Blocks allows setting your language standard globally, so you can set it once (rather than per-project). To do so, go to

                  , where XX is some number (e.g. 20, 17, etc…) representing a language standard:

                  <p>
                   If C++23, C++20, or C++17 appears in this list, select the one that represents the latest ISO standard (e.g. select

                    Have g++ follow the C++20 ISO language standard
                   </em>

                       After updating to the latest version of MinGW, you can see if newer language standard checkboxes appear in the

                              Having to reselect all of your settings options every time you create a new project is burdensome. Fortunately, most IDEs provide a way to export your settings. This is typically done by creating a new project template with the settings you want, and then selecting that project template when you create a new project.

                                   Once you create a new project with this template, it may not open any files. You can open up your .cpp file in the Solution Explorer window by going to Solution -&gt; &lt;Project Name&gt; -&gt; Source Files -&gt; &lt;template name&gt;.cpp.

You will occasionally see people quoting the standards document when explaining how something works.

                                       Your compiler is configured to use an older language standard that doesn’t support the feature you are using. Try selecting a newer language standard and compile your program again. You can use the program in lesson

If the latest version of your compiler still doesn’t support the feature you are trying to use, you can either try a different compiler that does provide support, or find a solution using a different set of features.
