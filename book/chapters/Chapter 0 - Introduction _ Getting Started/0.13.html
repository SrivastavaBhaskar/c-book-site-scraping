      If you get an error while trying to build this, you may have your project set up incorrectly. See

       0.8 -- A few common C++ problems

      <p>
       If the program prints “Error: Unable to determine your language standard”, your compiler may be non-conforming. If you are using a popular compiler and this is the case, please leave a comment below with relevant information (e.g. the name and version of your compiler).
       <p>
        If this program print a different language standard than you were expecting:
        <ul>
         <li>
          Check your IDE settings to ensure your compiler is configured to use the language standard you expect. See
          <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/configuring-your-compiler-choosing-a-language-standard/">
           0.12 -- Configuring your compiler: Choosing a language standard
          </a>
          for more information on how to do this for some of the major compilers. Make sure there are no typos or formatting errors. Some compilers require setting the language standard for each project rather than globally, so if you’ve just created a new project, this may be the case.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Your IDE or compiler may not even be reading the configuration file you’re editing (we see occasionally reader feedback on this with VS Code). If this seems like the case, please consult documentation for your IDE or compiler.
          </li>

            If you are just learning the language, it’s not necessary. Just be aware that some features from the upcoming version of the language may be missing, incomplete, buggy, or may change slightly.
