   An
   <strong>
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   </strong>
   is a piece of software designed to make it easy to develop, build, and debug your programs.
   <p>
    A typical modern IDE will include:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Some way to easily load and save your code files.
      <li>
       A code editor that has programming-friendly features, such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, integrated help, name completion, and automatic source code formatting.
       <li>
        A basic build system that will allow you to compile and link your program into an executable, and then run it.
        <li>
         An integrated debugger to make it easier to find and fix software defects.
         <li>
          Some way to install plugins so you can modify the IDE or add capabilities such as version control.
         </li>
        </li>
       </li>
      </li>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Some C++ IDEs will install and configure a C++ compiler and linker for you. Others will allow you to plug in a compiler and linker of your choice (installed separately).
     <p>
      And while you could do all of these things separately, it’s much easier to just install an IDE and be able to do all of these things from a single interface.
      <p>
       So let’s install one!
       <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
        Choosing an IDE
        <p>
         The obvious next question is, “which one?”. Many IDEs are free (in price), and you can install multiple IDEs if you wish to try more than one. We’ll recommend a few of our favorites below.
         <p>
          If you have some other IDE in mind, that’s fine too. The concepts we show you in these tutorials should generally work for any decent modern IDE. However, various IDEs use different names, layouts, key mappings, etc… so you may have to do a bit of searching in your IDE to find the equivalent functionality.

            Tip
            <p>
             To get the most value out of this site, we recommend installing an IDE that comes with a compiler that supports at least C++17.
             <p>
              If you’re restricted to using a compiler that only supports C++14 (due to educational or business constraints), many of the lessons and examples will still work. However, if you encounter a lesson that uses capabilities from C++17 (or newer) and you’re using an older language compiler, you’ll have to skip it or translate it to your version, which may or may not be easy.
              <p>
               You should not be using any compiler that does not support at least C++11 (which is typically considered the modern minimum spec for C++).
               <p>
                <p>
                 We recommend installing the newest version of a compiler. If you can’t use the newest version, these are the absolute minimum compiler versions with C++17 support:
                 <ul>
                  <li>
                   GCC/G++ 7
                   <li>
                    Clang++ 8
                    <li>
                     Visual Studio 2017 15.7
                    </li>
                   </li>
                  </li>
                 </ul>
                </p>
               </p>
              </p>
             </p>
            </p>

             <p>
              The default options selected on the right side of the screen should be fine, but please ensure that the

                   <p>
                    Code::Blocks 20.03 ships with an outdated version of MinGW that only supports C++17 (currently one version back from the latest version of C++). If you want to use the latest version of C++ (C++20), you will need to update MinGW. To do so, follow this procedure:

                     <li>
                      Install Code::Blocks as per the above.

                       Close Code::Blocks if it is open.

                        <li>
                         Navigate to your Code::Blocks install directory (probably C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks).
                         <li>
                          Rename the “MinGW” directory to “MinGW.bak” (in case something goes wrong).

                             <li>
                              Rename “mingw64” to “MinGW”.

                          Q: Can I use a web-based compiler?
                          <p>
                           Yes, for some things. While your IDE is downloading (or if you’re not sure you want to commit to installing one yet), you can continue this tutorial using a web-based compiler. We recommend one of the following:
                           <ul>
                            <li>

                              (can choose different versions of GCC or Clang)
                              <li>
                               <a href="https://godbolt.org/">
                                Godbolt
                               </a>
                               (can see assembly)
                              </li>
                             </li>
                            </li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>
                            Web-based compilers are fine for dabbling and simple exercises. However, they are generally quite limited in functionality -- many won’t allow you to create multiple files or effectively debug your programs, and most don’t support interactive input. You’ll want to migrate to a full IDE when you can.

                          Q: Can I use a command-line compiler (e.g. g++ on Linux)?
                          <p>
                           Yes, but we don’t recommend it for beginners. You’ll need to find your own editor and look up how to use it elsewhere. Learning to use a command line debugger is not as easy as an integrated debugger, and will make debugging your programs more difficult.

                          Q: Can I use other code editors or IDEs, such as Eclipse, Sublime, or Notepad++?
                          <p>
                           Yes, but we don’t recommend it for beginners. There are many great code editors and IDEs that can be configured to support a wide variety of languages, and allow you to mix and match plugins to customize your experience however you like. However, many of these editors and IDEs require additional configuration to compile C++ programs, and there’s a lot that can go wrong during that process. For beginners, we recommend something that works out of the box, so you can spend more time learning to code and less time trying to figure out why your code editor isn’t working properly with your compiler or debugger.

                         IDEs to avoid
                         <p>
                          You should avoid the following IDEs altogether because they do not support at least C++11, do not support C++ at all, or are no longer actively supported or maintained:
                          <ul>
                           <li>
                            Borland Turbo C++ -- does not support C++11
                            <li>
                             Visual Studio for Mac -- does not support C++
                             <li>
                              Dev C++ -- not actively supported
                             </li>
                            </li>
                           </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                           There is no good reason to use an outdated or unsupported compiler when lightweight, free alternatives that support modern C++ exist.

                            When things go wrong (a.k.a. when IDE stands for “I don’t even…”)
                            <p>
                             IDE installations seem to cause their fair share of problems. Installation might fail outright (or installation might work but the IDE will have problems when you try to use it due to a configuration issue). If you encounter such issues, try uninstalling the IDE (assuming it installed in the first place), reboot your machine, disable your antivirus or anti-malware temporarily, and try the installation again.
                             <p>
                              If you’re still encountering issues at this point, you have two options. The easier option is to try a different IDE. The other option is to fix the problem. Unfortunately, the causes of installation and configuration errors are varied and specific to the IDE software itself, and we’re unable to effectively advise on how to resolve such issues. In this case, we recommend copying the error message or problem you are having into your favorite search engine (such as Google or Duck Duck Go) and trying to find a forum post elsewhere from some poor soul who has inevitably encountered the same issue. Often there will be suggestions on things you can try to remedy the issue.

                                Once your IDE is installed (which can be one of the hardest steps if things don’t go as expected), or if you’re temporarily proceeding with a web-based compiler, you are ready to write your first program!
