   In lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/object-sizes-and-the-sizeof-operator/">
    4.3 -- Object sizes and the sizeof operator
   </a>
   , we noted that C++ has minimum size guarantees for each of the fundamental types.  However, the actual size of these types can vary based on the compiler and architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
   This variability was allowed so that the
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   data types could be set to the size that maximizes performance on a given architecture.  For example, a 32-bit computer will typically be able to process 32-bits of data at a time.  In such cases, an
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   would likely be set to a width of 32-bits, since this is the “natural” size of the data that the CPU operates on (and likely to be the most performant).
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    A reminder
   </p>
   <p>
    The number of bits a data type uses is called its width.  A wider data type is one that uses more bits, and a narrower data type is one that uses less bits.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   But what happens when we want our 32-bit CPU to modify an 8-bit value (such as a
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   ) or a 16-bit value?  Some 32-bit processors (such as 32-bit x86 CPUs) can manipulate 8-bit or 16-bit values directly.  However, doing so is often slower than manipulating 32-bit values!  Other 32-bit CPUs (like 32-bit PowerPC CPUs), can only operate on 32-bit values, and additional tricks must be employed to manipulate narrower values.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Numeric promotion
  </p>
  <p>
   Because C++ is designed to be portable and performant across a wide range of architectures, the language designers did not want to assume a given CPU would be able to efficiently manipulate values that were narrower than the natural data size for that CPU.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help address this challenge, C++ defines a category of type conversions informally called the
   <code>
    numeric promotions
   </code>
   .  A
   <strong>
    numeric promotion
   </strong>
   is the type conversion of certain narrower numeric types (such as a
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   ) to certain wider numeric types (typically
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   ) that can be processed efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
   All numeric promotions are value-preserving.  A
   <strong>
    value-preserving conversion
   </strong>
   (also called a
   <strong>
    safe conversion
   </strong>
   ) is one where every possible source value can be converted into an equal value of the destination type.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because promotions are safe, the compiler will freely use numeric promotion as needed, and will not issue a warning when doing so.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Numeric promotion reduces redundancy
  </p>
  <p>
   Numeric promotion solves another problem as well.  Consider the case where you wanted to write a function to print a value of type
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   :
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printInt(int x)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\n';
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   While this is straightforward, what happens if we want to also be able to print a value of type
   <code>
    short
   </code>
   , or type
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   ?  If type conversions did not exist, we’d have to write a different print function for
   <code>
    short
   </code>
   and another one for
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   .  And don’t forget another version for
   <code>
    unsigned char
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    signed char
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    unsigned short
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    wchar_t
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    char8_t
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    char16_t
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    char32_t
   </code>
   !  You can see how this quickly becomes unmanageable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Numeric promotion comes to the rescue here: we can write functions that have
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   and/or
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   parameters (such as the
   <code>
    printInt()
   </code>
   function above).  That same code can then be called with arguments of types that can be numerically promoted to match the types of the function parameters.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Numeric promotion categories
  </p>
  <p>
   The numeric promotion rules are divided into two subcategories:
   <code>
    integral promotions
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    floating point promotions
   </code>
   .  Only the conversions listed in these categories are considered to be numeric promotions.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Floating point promotions
  </p>
  <p>
   We’ll start with the easier one.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the
   <strong>
    floating point promotion
   </strong>
   rules, a value of type
   <code>
    float
   </code>
   can be converted to a value of type
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   This means we can write a function that takes a
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   and then call it with either a
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   or a
   <code>
    float
   </code>
   value:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printDouble(double d)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

int main()
{
    printDouble(5.0); // no conversion necessary
    printDouble(4.0f); // numeric promotion of float to double

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the second call to
   <code>
    printDouble()
   </code>
   , the
   <code>
    float
   </code>
   literal
   <code>
    4.0f
   </code>
   is promoted into a
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   , so that the type of argument matches the type of the function parameter.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Integral promotions
  </p>
  <p>
   The integral promotion rules are more complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the
   <strong>
    integral promotion
   </strong>
   rules, the following conversions can be made:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    signed char or signed short can be converted to int.
   </li>
   <li>
    unsigned char, char8_t, and unsigned short can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned int otherwise.
   </li>
   <li>
    If char is signed by default, it follows the signed char conversion rules above.  If it is unsigned by default, it follows the unsigned char conversion rules above.
   </li>
   <li>
    bool can be converted to int, with false becoming 0 and true becoming 1.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Assuming an 8 bit byte and an
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   size of 4 bytes or larger (which is typical these days), the above basically means that
   <code>
    bool
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    signed char
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    unsigned char
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    signed short
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    unsigned short
   </code>
   all get promoted to
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   There are a few other integral promotion rules that are used less often.  These can be found at
   <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Integral_promotion">
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Integral_promotion
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In most cases, this lets us write a function taking an
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   parameter, and then use it with a wide variety of other integral types.  For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printInt(int x)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

int main()
{
    printInt(2);

    short s{ 3 }; // there is no short literal suffix, so we'll use a variable for this one
    printInt(s); // numeric promotion of short to int

    printInt('a'); // numeric promotion of char to int
    printInt(true); // numeric promotion of bool to int

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   There are two things worth noting here.  First, on some architectures (e.g. with 2 byte ints) it is possible for some of the unsigned integral types to be promoted to
   <code>
    unsigned int
   </code>
   rather than
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, some narrower unsigned types (such as
   <code>
    unsigned char
   </code>
   ) may be promoted to larger signed types (such as
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   ).  So while integral promotion is value-preserving, it does not necessarily preserve the signedness (signed/unsigned) of the type.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Not all widening conversions are numeric promotions
  </p>
  <p>
   Some widening type conversions (such as
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   to
   <code>
    short
   </code>
   , or
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   to
   <code>
    long
   </code>
   ) are not considered to be numeric promotions in C++ (they are
   <code>
    numeric conversions
   </code>
   , which we’ll cover shortly in lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/numeric-conversions/">
    10.3 -- Numeric conversions
   </a>
   ).  This is because such conversions do not assist in the goal of converting smaller types to larger types that can be processed more efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
   The distinction is mostly academic.  However, in certain cases, the compiler will favor numeric promotions over numeric conversions.  We’ll see examples where this makes a difference when we cover function overload resolution (in upcoming lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/function-overload-resolution-and-ambiguous-matches/">
    11.3 -- Function overload resolution and ambiguous matches
   </a>
   ).
