   In the previous lesson (
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-structs-members-and-member-selection/">
    13.7 -- Introduction to structs, members, and member selection
   </a>
   ), we talked about how to define structs, instantiate struct objects, and access their members. In this lesson, we’ll discuss how structs are initialized.
   <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
    Data members are not initialized by default
    <p>
     Much like normal variables, data members are not initialized by default. Consider the following struct:
     <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Employee
{
    int id; // note: no initializer here
    int age;
    double wage;
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe; // note: no initializer here either
    std::cout &lt;&lt; joe.id &lt;&lt; '\n';

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
     <p>
      Because we have not provided any initializers, when
      <code>
       joe
      </code>
      is instantiated,
      <code>
       joe.id
      </code>
      ,
      <code>
       joe.age
      </code>
      , and
      <code>
       joe.wage
      </code>
      will all be uninitialized. We will then get undefined behavior when we try to print the value of
      <code>
       joe.id
      </code>
      .
      <p>
       However, before we show you how to initialize a struct, let’s take a short detour.

        What is an aggregate?

         In general programming, an
         <strong>
          aggregate data type
         </strong>
         (also called an
         <strong>
          aggregate
         </strong>
         ) is any type that can contain multiple data members. Some types of aggregates allow members to have different types (e.g. structs), while others require that all members must be of a single type (e.g. arrays).
         <p>
          In C++, the definition of an aggregate is narrower and quite a bit more complicated.

             To simplify a bit, an aggregate in C++ is either a C-style array (

           The key thing to understand at this point is that structs with only data members are aggregates.
           <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
            Aggregate initialization of a struct
            <p>
             Because a normal variable can only hold a single value, we only need to provide a single initializer:
             <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int x { 5 };</code></pre>
             <p>
              However, a struct can have multiple members:
              <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};</code></pre>
              <p>
               When we define an object with a struct type, we need some way to initialize multiple members at initialization time:
               <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">Employee joe; // how do we initialize joe.id, joe.age, and joe.wage?</code></pre>
               <p>
                Aggregates use a form of initialization called
                <strong>
                 aggregate initialization
                </strong>
                , which allows us to directly initialize the members of aggregates. To do this, we provide an
                <strong>
                 initializer list
                </strong>
                as an initializer, which is just a braced list of comma-separated values.
                <p>
                 There are 2 primary forms of aggregate initialization:
                 <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee frank = { 1, 32, 60000.0 }; // copy-list initialization using braced list
    Employee joe { 2, 28, 45000.0 };     // list initialization using braced list (preferred)

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                 <p>
                  Each of these initialization forms does a
                  <strong>
                   memberwise initialization
                  </strong>
                  , which means each member in the struct is initialized in the order of declaration. Thus,
                  <code>
                   Employee joe { 2, 28, 45000.0 };
                  </code>
                  first initializes
                  <code>
                   joe.id
                  </code>
                  with value
                  <code>
                   2
                  </code>
                  , then
                  <code>
                   joe.age
                  </code>
                  with value
                  <code>
                   28
                  </code>
                  , and
                  <code>
                   joe.wage
                  </code>
                  with value
                  <code>
                   45000.0
                  </code>
                  last.

                    Best practice
                    <p>
                     Prefer the (non-copy) braced list form when initializing aggregates.

                  </div>
                  <p>
                   In C++20, we can also initialize (some) aggregates using a parenthesized list of values:
                   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">    Employee robert ( 3, 45, 62500.0 );  // direct initialization using parenthesized list (C++20)</code></pre>
                   <p>
                    We recommend avoiding this last form as much as possible, as it doesn’t currently work with aggregates that utilize brace elision (notably
                    <code>
                     std::array
                    </code>
                    ).
                    <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
                     Missing initializers in an initializer list
                     <p>
                      If an aggregate is initialized but the number of initialization values is fewer than the number of members, then all remaining members are initialized with an empty initializer list. In most cases, this will perform value-initialization on those members.
                      <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};

{

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                      <p>
                       In the above example,
                       <code>
                        joe.id
                       </code>
                       will be initialized with value
                       <code>
                        2
                       </code>
                       <code>
                        joe.age
                       </code>
                       will be initialized with value
                       <code>
                        28
                       </code>
                       , and because
                       <code>
                        joe.wage
                       </code>
                       wasn’t given an explicit initializer, it will be value-initialized to
                       <code>
                        0.0
                       </code>
                       .
                       <p>
                        This means we can generally use an empty initialization list to value-initialize all members of the struct:
                        <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">Employee joe {}; // value-initialize all members</code></pre>

                           operator&lt;&lt;
                          </code>
                          to print an enumeration. It’s also useful to overload
                          <code>
                           operator&lt;&lt;

                          for structs.

                           Here’s the same example as in the previous section, now with an overloaded

                             was indeed value-initialized to
                             <code>

                               above aren’t intuitive, as there is no indication of what these values mean. Let’s do the same example, but update our output function to be a bit more descriptive:

                                     When initializing a struct from a list of values, the initializers are applied to the members in order of declaration.

                                      Now consider what would happen if you were to update this struct definition to add a new member that is not the last member:
                                      <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Foo
{

                                       Now all your initialization values have shifted, and worse, the compiler may not detect this as an error (after all, the syntax is still valid).
                                       <p>
                                        To help avoid this, C++20 adds a new way to initialize struct members called
                                        <strong>
                                         designated initializers
                                        </strong>
                                        . Designated initializers allow you to explicitly define which initialization values map to which members. The members can be initialized using list or copy initialization, and must be initialized in the same order in which they are declared in the struct, otherwise a warning or error will result. Members not designated an initializer will be value initialized.

                                           When doing designated initializers of single values using braces, Clang improperly issues warning “braces around scalar initializer”. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

                                         Designated initializers are nice because they provide some level of self-documentation and help ensure you don’t inadvertently mix up the order of your initialization values. However, designated initializers also clutter up the initializer list significantly, so we won’t recommend their use as a best practice at this time.
                                         <p>
                                          Also, because there’s no enforcement that designated initializers are being used consistently everywhere an aggregate is initialized, it’s a good idea to avoid adding new members to the middle of an existing aggregate definition, to avoid the risk of initializer shifting.

                                             When adding a new member to an aggregate, it’s safest to add it to the bottom of the definition list so the initializers for other members don’t shift.

                                            As shown in the prior lesson, we can assign values to members of structs individually:
                                            <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe { 1, 32, 60000.0 };

    joe.age  = 33;      // Joe had a birthday
    joe.wage = 66000.0; // and got a raise

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                                            <p>
                                             This is fine for single members, but not great when we want to update many members. Similar to initializing a struct with an initializer list, you can also assign values to structs using an initializer list (which does memberwise assignment):
