    13.7 -- Introduction to structs, members, and member selection
   </a>
   , we introduced the struct program-defined type, which can contain member variables.  Here is an example of a struct used to hold a date:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};
};</code></pre>
  <p>
   Now, if we want to print the date to the screen (something we probably want to do a lot), it makes sense to write a function to do this.  Here’s a full program:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    // here are our member variables
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};
};

void print(const Date&amp; date)
{
    // member variables accessed using member selection operator (.)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; date.year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; date.month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; date.day;
}

int main()
{
    Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // aggregate initialize our struct

    today.day = 16; // member variables accessed using member selection operator (.)
    print(today);   // non-member function accessed using normal calling convention

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This program prints:
  </p>
  <pre>2020/10/16
</pre>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   The separation of properties and actions
  </p>
  <p>
   Take a look around you -- everywhere you look are objects: books and buildings and food and even you. Real-life objects have two major components to them: 1) Some number of observable properties (e.g. weight, color, size, solidity, shape, etc…), and 2) Some number of actions that they can perform or have performed on them (e.g. being opened, damaging something else, etc…) based on those properties. These properties and actions are inseparable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In programming, we represent properties with variables, and actions with functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   example above, note that we have defined our properties (the member variables of
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   ) and the actions we perform using those properties (the function
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   ) separately.  We are left to infer a connection between
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   based solely on the
   <code>
    const Date&amp;
   </code>
   parameter of
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While we could put both
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   into a namespace (to make it clearer that the two are meant to be packaged together), that adds yet more names into our program and more namespace prefixes, cluttering our code.
  </p>
  <p>
   It sure would be nice if there were some way to define our properties and actions together, as a single package.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Member functions
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to having member variables, class types (which includes structs, classes, and unions) can also have their own functions!  Functions that belong to a class type are called
   <strong>
    member functions
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    As an aside…
   </p>
   <p>
    In other object-oriented languages (such as Java and C#), these are called
    <strong>
     methods
    </strong>
    .  Although the term “method” is not used in C++, programmers who learned one of those other languages first may still use that term.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Functions that are not member functions are called
   <strong>
    non-member functions
   </strong>
   (or occasionally
   <strong>
    free functions
   </strong>
   ) to distinguish them from member functions.  The
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   function above is a non-member function.

    Author’s note
   </p>
   <p>
    In this lesson, we’ll use structs to show examples of member functions -- but everything we show here applies equally well to classes.  For reasons that will become obvious when we get there, we’ll show examples of classes with member functions in upcoming lesson (

    ).
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Member functions must be declared inside the class type definition, and can be defined inside or outside of the class type definition.  As a reminder, a definition is also a declaration, so if we define a member function inside the class, that counts as a declaration.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep things simple, we’ll define our member functions inside the class type definition for now.

   A member function example
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s rewrite the
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   example from the top of the lesson, converting
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   from a non-member function into a member function:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">// Member function version
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print() // defines a member function named print
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // aggregate initialize our struct

    today.day = 16; // member variables accessed using member selection operator (.)
    today.print();  // member functions also accessed using member selection operator (.)

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This program compiles and produces the same result as above:
  </p>
  <pre>2020/10/16
</pre>
  <p>
   There are three key differences between the non-member and member examples:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    Where we declare (and define) the
    <code>
     print()
    </code>
    function
   </li>
   <li>
    How we call the
    <code>
     print()
    </code>
    function
   </li>
   <li>
    How we access members inside the
    <code>
     print()
    </code>
    function
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Let’s explore each of these in turn.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Member functions are declared inside the class type definition
  </p>
  <p>
   In the non-member example, the
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   non-member function is defined outside of the
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   struct, in the global namespace.  By default, it has external linkage, so it could be called from other source files (with the appropriate forward declaration).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the member example, the
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   member function is declared (and in this case, defined) inside the
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   struct definition.  Because
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   is declared as part of the
   <code>
    Date
   </code>
   , this tells the compiler that
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   is a member function.
  </p>
  <p>
   Member functions defined inside the class type definition are implicitly inline, so they will not cause violations of the one-definition rule if the class type definition is included into multiple code files.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Related content
   </p>
   <p>
    Member functions can also be (forward) declared inside the class definition, and defined after the class definition.  We cover this in lesson
    <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/classes-and-header-files/">
     15.2 -- Classes and header files

  </div>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Calling member functions (and the implicit object)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the non-member example, we call
   <code>
    print(today)
   </code>
   , where
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   is (explicitly) passed as an argument.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the member example, we call
   <code>
    today.print()
   </code>
   .  This syntax, which uses the member selection operator (.) to select the member function to call, is consistent with how we access member variables (e.g.
   <code>
    today.day = 16;
   </code>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   All (non-static) member functions must be called using an object of that class type. In this case,
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   is the object that
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   is being called on.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that in the member function case, we don’t need to pass
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   as an argument.  The object that a member function is called on is
   <em>
    implicitly
   </em>
   passed to the member function.  For this reason, the object that a member function is called on is often called
   <strong>
    the implicit object
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, when we call
   <code>
    today.print()
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   is the implicit object, and it is implicitly passed to the
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   member function.

   Here’s the non-member version of

   This version of
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   has reference parameter
   <code>
    const Date&amp; date
   </code>
   .  Within the function, we access the members through this reference parameter, as
   <code>
    date.year
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    date.month
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    date.day
   </code>
   .  When
   <code>
    print(today)
   </code>
   is called, the
   <code>
    date
   </code>
   reference parameter is bound to argument
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    date.year

   ,
   <code>
    date.month

   , and
   <code>
    date.day

   evaluate to
   <code>

   ,
   <code>
    today.month
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    today.day
   </code>
   respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now let’s look at the definition of the
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   member function again:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">    void print() // defines a member function named print()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the member example, we access the members as
   <code>
    year
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    month,
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    day
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Inside a member function, any member identifier that is not prefixed with the member selection operator (.) is associated with the implicit object.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, when
   <code>
    today.print()
   </code>
   is called,
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   is our implicit object, and
   <code>
    year

   ,
   <code>
    month
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    day
   </code>
   (which are not prefixed) evaluate to the values of
   <code>
    today.year

   Another member function example
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s an example with a slightly more complex member function:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

struct Person
{
    std::string name{};
    int age{};

    void kisses(const Person&amp; person)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; " kisses " &lt;&lt; person.name &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    Person joe{ "Joe", 29 };
    Person kate{ "Kate", 27 };

    joe.kisses(kate);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This produces the output:
  </p>
  <pre>Joe kisses Kate
</pre>
  <p>
   Let’s examine how this works.  First, we define two
   <code>
    Person
   </code>
   structs,
   <code>
    joe
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    kate
   </code>
   .  Next, we call
   <code>
    joe.kisses(kate)
   </code>
   .
   <code>
    joe
   </code>
   is the implicit object here, and
   <code>
    kate
   </code>
   is passed as an explicit argument.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the
   <code>
    kisses()
   </code>
   member function executes, the identifier
   <code>
    name
   </code>
   doesn’t use the member selection operator (.), so it refers to the implicit object, which is
   <code>
    joe
   </code>
   .  So this resolves to
   <code>
    joe.name
   </code>
   .
   <code>
    person.name
   </code>
   uses the member selection operator, so it does not refer to the implicit object.  Since
   <code>
    person
   </code>
   is a reference for
   <code>
    kate
   </code>
   , this resolves to
   <code>
    kate.name
   </code>
   .

   </p>
   <p>
    Without a member function, we would have written
    <code>
     kisses(joe, kate)
    </code>
    .  With a member function, we write
    <code>
     joe.kisses(kate)
    </code>
    .  Note how much better the latter reads, and how it makes clear exactly which object is initiating the action and which is in support.

   Member variables and functions can be defined in any order
  </p>
  <p>
   The C++ compiler normally compiles code from top to bottom.  For each name encountered, the compiler determines whether it has already seen a declaration for that name, so that it can do proper type checking.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non-members must be declared before they can be used, or the compiler will complain:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int x()
{
    return y(); // error: y not declared yet, so compiler doesn't know what it is
}
 
int y()
{
    return 5;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   To address this, we typically either define our non-members in rough order of use (which requires work whenever we need to change the order), or use forward declarations (which requires work to add).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, inside a class definition, this restriction doesn’t apply: you can access member variables and member functions before they are declared.  This means you can define member variables and member functions in any order you like!
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Foo
{
    int z() { return m_data; } // We can access data members before they are defined
    int x() { return y(); }    // We can can access member functions before they are defined

    int m_data { y() };        // This even works in default member initializers (see warning below)
    int y() { return 5; }
};</code></pre>
  <p>
   We discuss a recommended order for member definition in upcoming lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/the-benefits-of-data-hiding-encapsulation/">
    14.8 -- The benefits of data hiding (encapsulation)

    Warning
   </p>
   <p>
    Data members are initialized in order of declaration.  If the initialization of a data member accesses another data member that isn’t declared until later (and thus hasn’t been initialized yet), the initialization will result in undefined behavior.
   </p>
   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Bad
{
    int m_bad1 { m_data }; // undefined behavior: m_bad1 initialized before m_data
    int m_bad2 { fcn() };  // undefined behavior: m_bad2 initialized before m_data (accessed through fcn())

    int m_data { 5 };
    int fcn() { return m_data; }
};</code></pre>
   <p>
    For this reason, it’s generally a good idea to avoid using other members inside default member initializers.

   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    For advanced readers
   </p>
   <p>
    To allow the definition of data members and member functions in any order, compilers employ a neat trick.  When the compiler encounters a member function defined inside the class definition:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The member function is implicitly forward declared.
    </li>
    <li>
     The member function definition is moved immediately after the end of the class definition.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    That way, by the time the compiler actually compiles the member function definitions, it has already seen the full class definition (containing declarations for all members!)
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, when the compiler encounters this:
   </p>
   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Foo
{
    int z() { return m_data; } // m_data not declared yet
    int x() { return y(); }    // y not declared yet
    int y() { return 5; }

    int m_data{};
};</code></pre>
   <p>
    It will compile the equivalent of this:
   </p>
   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Foo
{
    int z(); // forward declaration of Foo::z()
    int x(); // forward declaration of Foo::x()
    int y(); // forward declaration of Foo::y()

    int m_data{};
};

int Foo::z() { return m_data; } // m_data already declared above
int Foo::x() { return y(); }    // y already declared above

   Structs and member functions
  </p>
  <p>
   In C, structs only have data members, not member functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In C++, while designing classes, Bjarne Stroustrup spent some amount of time considering whether structs (which were inherited from C) should be granted the ability to have member functions. Upon consideration, he determined that they should.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    As an aside…
   </p>
   <p>
    That decision led to a cascade of other questions about what other new C++ capabilities structs should have access to.  Bjarne was concerned that giving structs access to a limited subset of capabilities would end up adding complexity and edge-cases to the language.  For simplicity, he ultimately decided that structs and classes would have a unified ruleset (meaning structs can do everything classes can, and vice-versa), and convention could dictate how structs would actually be used.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   In modern C++, it is fine for structs to have member functions.  This excludes constructors, which are a special type of member function that we cover in upcoming lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-constructors/">
    14.9 -- Introduction to constructors
   </a>
   .  A class type with a constructor is no longer an aggregate, and we want our structs to remain aggregates.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Best practice
   </p>
   <p>
    Member functions can be used with both structs and classes.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, structs should avoid defining constructor member functions, as doing so makes them a non-aggregate.

   Class types with no data members
  </p>
  <p>
   It is possible to create class types with no data members (e.g. class types that only have member functions).  It is also possible to instantiate objects of such a class type:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Foo
{
    void printHi() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hi!\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    Foo f{};
    f.printHi(); // requires object to call

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   However, if a class type does not have any data members, then using a class type is probably overkill.  In such cases, consider using a namespace (containing non-member functions) instead.  This makes it clearer to the reader that no data is being managed (and does not require an object to be instantiated to call the functions).
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

namespace Foo
{
    void printHi() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hi!\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    Foo::printHi(); // no object needed

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Best practice
   </p>
   <p>
    If your class type has no data members, prefer using a namespace.
