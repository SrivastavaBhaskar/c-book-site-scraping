   In lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constant-variables-named-constants/">
    5.1 -- Constant variables (named constants)
   </a>
   , you learned that objects of a fundamental data type (
   <code>
    int
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    char
   </code>
   , etc…) can be made constant via the
   <code>
    const
   </code>
   keyword.  All const variables must be initialized at time of creation.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">const int x;      // compile error: not initialized
const int y{};    // ok: value initialized
const int z{ 5 }; // ok: list initialized</code></pre>
  <p>
   Similarly, class type objects (struct, classes, and unions) can also be made const by using the
   <code>
    const
   </code>
   keyword.  Such objects must also be initialized at the time of creation.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};
};

int main()
{
    const Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // const class type object

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Just like with normal variables, you’ll generally want to make your class type objects const (or constexpr) when you need to ensure they aren’t modified after creation.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Modifying the data members of const objects is disallowed
  </p>
  <p>
   Once a const class type object has been initialized, any attempt to modify the data members of the object is disallowed, as it would violate the const-ness of the object.  This includes both changing member variables directly (if they are public), or calling member functions that set the value of member variables.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void incrementDay()
    {
        ++day;
    }
};

int main()
{
    const Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // const

    today.day += 1;        // compile error: can't modify member of const object
    today.incrementDay();  // compile error: can't call member function that modifies member of const object

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Const objects may not call non-const member functions
  </p>
  <p>
   You may be surprised to find that this code also causes a compilation error:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

int main()
{
    const Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // const

    today.print();  // compile error: can't call non-const member function

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Even though
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   does not try to modify a member variable, our call to
   <code>
    today.print()
   </code>
   is still a const violation.  This happens because the
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   member function itself is not declared as const.  The compiler won’t let us call a non-const member function on a const object.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Const member functions
  </p>
  <p>
   To address the above issue, we need to make
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   a const member function.  A
   <strong>
    const member function
   </strong>
   is a member function that guarantees it will not modify the object or call any non-const member functions (as they may modify the object).
  </p>
  <p>
   Making
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   a const member function is easy -- we simply append the
   <code>
    const
   </code>
   keyword to the function prototype, after the parameter list, but before the function body:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print() const // now a const member function
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

int main()
{
    const Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // const

    today.print();  // ok: const object can call const member function

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example,
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   has been made a const member function, which means we can call it on const objects (such as
   <code>
    today
   </code>
   ).
  </p>

    For advanced readers
   </p>
   <p>
    For member functions defined outside of the class definition, the
    <code>
     const
    </code>
    keyword must be used on both the function declaration in the class definition, and on the function definition outside the class definition.  We show an example of this in lesson
    <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/classes-and-header-files/">
     15.2 -- Classes and header files
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Constructors may not be made const, as they need to initialize the members of the object, which requires modifying them.  We cover constructors in lesson
    <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-constructors/">
     14.9 -- Introduction to constructors
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   A const member function that attempts to change a member variable or call a non-const member function will cause a compiler error to occur.  For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void incrementDay() const // made const
    {
        ++day; // compile error: const function can't modify member
    }
};

int main()
{
    const Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // const

    today.incrementDay();

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In this example,
   <code>
    incrementDay()
   </code>
   has been marked as a const member function, but it attempts to change
   <code>
    day
   </code>
   .  This will cause a compiler error.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Const member functions may be called on non-const objects
  </p>
  <p>
   Const member functions may also be called on non-const objects:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print() const // const
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // non-const

    today.print();  // ok: can call const member function on non-const object

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Because const member functions can be called on both const and non-const objects, if a member function does not modify the state of the object, it should be made const.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Best practice
   </p>
   <p>
    A member function that does not (and will not ever) modify the state of the object should be made const, so that it can be called on both const and non-const objects.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Be careful about what member functions you apply
   <code>
    const
   </code>
   to.  Once a member function is made const, that function can be called on const objects.  Later removal of
   <code>
    const
   </code>
   on a member function will break any code that calls that member function on a const object.

   Const objects via pass by const reference
  </p>
  <p>
   Although instantiating const local variables is one way to create const objects, a more common way to get a const object is by passing an object to a function by const reference.
  </p>
  <p>
   In lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/pass-by-lvalue-reference/">
    12.5 -- Pass by lvalue reference
   </a>
   , we covered the merits of passing class type arguments by const reference instead of by value.  To recap, passing a class type argument by value causes a copy of the class to be made (which is slow) -- most of the time, we don’t need a copy, a reference to the original argument works just fine and avoids making a copy.  We typically make the reference const to allow the function to accept const lvalue arguments and rvalue arguments (e.g. literals and temporary objects).
  </p>
  <p>
   Can you figure out what’s wrong with the following code?
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print() // non-const
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

void doSomething(const Date&amp; date)
{
    date.print();
}

int main()
{
    Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // non-const
    today.print();

    doSomething(today);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   The answer is that inside of the
   <code>
    doSomething()
   </code>
   function,
   <code>
    date
   </code>
   is treated as a const object (because it was passed by const reference).  And with that const
   <code>
    date
   </code>
   , we’re calling non-const member function
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   .  Since we can’t call non-const member functions on const objects, this will cause a compile error.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fix is simple: make
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   const:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Date
{
    int year {};
    int month {};
    int day {};

    void print() const // now const
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day;
    }
};

void doSomething(const Date&amp; date)
{
    date.print();
}

int main()
{
    Date today { 2020, 10, 14 }; // non-const
    today.print();

    doSomething(today);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Now in function
   <code>
    doSomething()
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    const date
   </code>
   will be able to successfully call const member function
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Member function const and non-const overloading
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, although it is not done very often, it is possible to overload a member function to have a const and non-const version of the same function.  This works because the const qualifier is considered part of the function’s signature, so two functions which differ only in their const-ness are considered distinct.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Something
{
    void print()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "non-const\n";
    }

    void print() const
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "const\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    Something s1{};
    s1.print(); // calls print()

    const Something s2{};
    s2.print(); // calls print() const
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This prints:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">non-const
const</code></pre>
  <p>
   Overloading a function with a const and non-const version is typically done when the return value needs to differ in constness.  This is pretty rare.
