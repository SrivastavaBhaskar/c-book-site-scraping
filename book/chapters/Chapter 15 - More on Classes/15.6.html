   In the lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-global-variables/">
    7.4 -- Introduction to global variables
   </a>
   , we introduced global variables, and in lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/static-local-variables/">
    7.11 -- Static local variables
   </a>
   , we introduced static local variables. Both of these types of variables have static duration, meaning they are created at the start of the program, and destroyed at the end of the program. Such variables keep their values even if they go out of scope.
   <p>
    For example:
    <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int generateID()
{
    static int s_id{ 0 }; // static local variable
    return ++s_id;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; generateID() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; generateID() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; generateID() &lt;&lt; '\n';

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
     This program prints:
     <pre>1
2
3
</pre>
     <p>
      Note that static local variable
      <code>
       s_id
      </code>
      has kept its value across multiple function calls.
      <p>
       Class types bring two more uses for the
       <code>
        static
       </code>
       keyword: static member variables, and static member functions. Fortunately, these uses are fairly straightforward. We’ll talk about static member variables in this lesson, and static member functions in the next.
       <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
        Static member variables
        <p>
         Before we go into the static keyword as applied to member variables, first consider the following class:
         <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Something
{
    int value{ 1 };
};

int main()
{
    Something first{};
    Something second{};
    
    first.value = 2;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; first.value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; second.value &lt;&lt; '\n';

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
         <p>
          When we instantiate a class object, each object gets its own copy of all normal member variables. In this case, because we have declared two
          <code>
           Something
          </code>
          class objects, we end up with two copies of
          <code>
           value
          </code>
          :
          <code>
           first.value
          </code>
          , and
          <code>
           second.value
          </code>
          .
          <code>
           first.value
          </code>
          is distinct from
          <code>
           second.value
          </code>
          . Consequently, the program above prints:
          <pre>2
1
</pre>
          <p>
           Member variables of a class can be made static by using the
           <code>
            static
           </code>
           keyword. Unlike normal member variables,
           <strong>
            static member variables
           </strong>
           are shared by all objects of the class. Consider the following program, similar to the above:
           <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct Something
{
    static int s_value; // declare s_value as static (initializer moved below)
};

int Something::s_value{ 1 }; // define and initialize s_value to 1 (we'll discuss this section below)

int main()
{
    Something first{};
    Something second{};

    first.s_value = 2;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; first.s_value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; second.s_value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
           <p>
            This program produces the following output:
            <pre>2
2
</pre>
            <p>
             Because
             <code>
              s_value
             </code>
             is a static member variable,
             <code>
              s_value
             </code>
             is shared between all objects of the class. Consequently,
             <code>
              first.s_value
             </code>
             is the same variable as
             <code>
              second.s_value
             </code>
             . The above program shows that the value we set using
             <code>
              first
             </code>
             can be accessed using
             <code>
              second
             </code>
             !

              Static members are not associated with class objects
              <p>
               Although you can access static members through objects of the class (as shown with
               <code>
                first.s_value
               </code>
               and
               <code>
                second.s_value
               </code>
               in the example above), static members exist even if no objects of the class have been instantiated! This makes sense: they are created at the start of the program and destroyed at the end of the program, so their lifetime is not bound to a class object like a normal member.
               <p>
                Essentially, static members are global variables that live inside the scope region of the class. There is very little difference between a static member of a class and a normal variable inside a namespace.

                 exists independently of any class objects, it can be accessed directly using the class name and the scope resolution operator (in this case,
                 <code>

                   Something
                  </code>

                  </code>

                   Defining and initializing static member variables
                   <p>
                    When we declare a static member variable inside a class type, we’re telling the compiler about the existence of a static member variable, but not actually defining it (much like a forward declaration). Because static member variables are essentially global variables, you must explicitly define (and optionally initialize) the static member outside of the class, in the global scope.
                    <p>
                     In the example above, we do so via this line:
                     <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int Something::s_value{ 1 }; // define and initialize s_value to 1</code></pre>
                     <p>
                      This line serves two purposes: it instantiates the static member variable (just like a global variable), and initializes it. In this case, we’re providing the initialization value
                      <code>
                       1
                      </code>
                      . If no initializer is provided, static member variables are zero-initialized by default.
                      <p>
                       Note that this static member definition is not subject to access controls: you can define and initialize the value even if it’s declared as private (or protected) in the class (as definitions are not considered to be a form of access).
                       <p>
                        For non-template classes, if the class is defined in a header (.h) file, the static member definition is usually placed in the associated code file for the class (e.g.
                        <code>
                         Something.cpp
                        </code>
                        ). Alternatively, the member can also be defined as
                        <code>
                         inline
                        </code>
                        and placed below the class definition in the header (this is useful for header-only libraries). If the class is defined in a source (.cpp) file, the static member definition is usually placed directly underneath the class. Do not put the static member definition in a header file (much like a global variable, if that header file gets included more than once, you’ll end up with multiple definitions, which will cause a linker error).
                        <p>
                         For template classes, the (templated) static member definition is typically placed directly underneath the template class definition in the header file (this doesn’t violate the ODR because such definitions are implicitly inline).

                          Initialization of static member variables inside the class definition
                          <p>
                           There are a few shortcuts to the above. First, when the static member is a constant integral type (which includes
                           <code>
                            char
                           </code>
                           and
                           <code>
                            bool
                           </code>
                           ) or a const enum, the static member can be initialized inside the class definition:
                           <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">class Whatever
{
public:
    static const int s_value{ 4 }; // a static const int can be defined and initialized directly
};</code></pre>
                           <p>
                            In the above example, because the static member variable is a const int, no explicit definition line is needed. This shortcut is allowed because these specific const types are compile-time constants.
                            <p>

                             , we introduced inline variables, which are variables that are allowed to have multiple definitions. C++17 allows static members to be inline variables:
                             <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">class Whatever
{
public:
    static inline int s_value{ 4 }; // a static inline variable can be defined and initialized directly
};</code></pre>
                             <p>
                              Such variables can be initialized inside the class definition regardless of whether they are constant or not. This is the preferred method of defining and initializing static members.
                              <p>
                               Because
                               <code>
                                constexpr
                               </code>
                               members are implicitly inline (as of C++17), static
                               <code>

                                   object is created, the constructor initializes

                                   and then increments the value for the next object. This guarantees that each instantiated

                                    Something

                                   object receives a unique id (incremented in the order of creation).
                                   <p>
                                    Giving each object a unique ID can help when debugging, as it can be used to differentiate objects that otherwise have identical data. This is particularly true when working with arrays of data.

                                     Static member variables are also useful when the class needs to utilize a lookup table (e.g. an array used to store a set of pre-calculated values). By making the lookup table static, only one copy exists for all objects, rather than making a copy for each object instantiated. This can save substantial amounts of memory.

                                       to deduce its type from the initializer, or Class Template Argument Deduction (CTAD) to deduce template type arguments from the initializer.

                                         The reasons for this distinction being made are quite complicated, but boil down to there being certain cases that can occur with non-static members that lead to ambiguity or non-intuitive results. This does not occur for static members. Thus non-static members are restricted from using these features, whereas static members are not.
