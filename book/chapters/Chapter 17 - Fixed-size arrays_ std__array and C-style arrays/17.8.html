   The C-style array passing challenge
   <p>
    The designers of the C language had a problem. Consider the following simple program:
    <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void print(int val)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; val;
}

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    print(x);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
     When
     <code>
      print(x)
     </code>
     is called, the value of argument
     <code>
      x
     </code>
     (
     <code>
      5
     </code>
     ) is copied into parameter
     <code>
      val
     </code>
     . Within the body of the function, the value of
     <code>
      val
     </code>
     (
     <code>
      5
     </code>
     ) is printed to the console. Because
     <code>
      x
     </code>
     is cheap to copy, there’s no problem here.
     <p>
      Now consider the following similar program, which uses a 1000 element C-style int array instead of a single int:
      <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printElementZero(int arr[1000])
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; arr[0]; // print the value of the first element
}

int main()
{
    int x[1000] { 5 };   // define an array with 1000 elements, x[0] is initialized to 5
    printElementZero(x);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
       This program also compiles and prints the expected value (
       <code>
        5
       </code>
       ) to the console.
       <p>
        While the code in this example is similar to the code in the prior example, mechanically it works a bit different than you might expect (we’ll explain this below). And that is due to the solution that the C designers came up to solve for two major challenges.
        <p>
         First, copying a 1000 element array every time a function is called is expensive (and even more so if the elements are an expensive-to-copy type), so we want to avoid that. But how? C doesn’t have references, so using pass by reference to avoid making a copy of function arguments wasn’t an option.
         <p>
          Second, we want to be able to write a single function that can accept array arguments of different lengths. Ideally, our
          <code>
           printElementZero()
          </code>
          function in the example above should be callable with arrays arguments of any length (since element 0 is guaranteed to exist). We don’t want to have to write a different function for every possible array length that we want to use as an argument. But how? C has no syntax to specify “any length” arrays, nor does it support templates, nor can arrays of one length be converted to arrays of another length (presumably because doing so would involve making an expensive copy).
          <p>
           The designers of the C language came up with a clever solution (inherited by C++ for compatibility reasons) that solves for both of these issues:
           <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printElementZero(int arr[1000]) // doesn't make a copy
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; arr[0]; // print the value of the first element
}

int main()
{
    int x[7] { 5 };      // define an array with 7 elements
    printElementZero(x); // somehow works!

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
           <p>
            Somehow, the above example passes a 7 element array to a function expecting a 1000 element array, without any copies being made. In this lesson, we’ll explore how this works.
            <p>
             We’ll also take a look at why the solution the C designers picked is dangerous, and not well suited for use in modern C++.
             <p>
              But first, we need to cover two subtopics.
              <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
               Array to pointer conversions (array decay)
               <p>
                In most cases, when a C-style array is used in an expression, the array will be implicitly converted into a pointer to the element type, initialized with the address of the first element (with index 0). Colloquially, this is called
                <strong>
                 array decay
                </strong>
                (or just
                <strong>
                 decay
                </strong>
                for short).
                <p>
                 You can see this in the following program:
                 <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iomanip&gt; // for std::boolalpha
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    int arr[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // our array has elements of type int

    // First, let's prove that arr decays into an int* pointer

    auto ptr{ arr }; // evaluation causes arr to decay, type deduction should deduce type int*
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha &lt;&lt; (typeid(ptr) == typeid(int*)) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // Prints true if the type of ptr is int*

    // Now let's prove that the pointer holds the address of the first element of the array

    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha &lt;&lt; (&amp;arr[0] == ptr) &lt;&lt; '\n';

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                 <p>
                  On the author’s machine, this printed:
                  <pre>true
true
</pre>
                  <p>
                   There is nothing special about the pointer that an array decays into. It is a normal pointer that holds the address of the first element.
                   <p>
                    Similarly, a const array (e.g.
                    <code>
                     const int arr[5]
                    </code>
                    ) decays into a pointer-to-const (
                    <code>
                     const int*
                    </code>
                    ).

                      <p>
                       In C++, there are a few common cases where an C-style array doesn’t decay:

                         When used as an argument to

                          sizeof()
                         </code>

                         </code>
                         .
                         <li>
                          When taking the address of the array using

                    <p>
                     Because C-style arrays decay into a pointer in most cases, it’s a common fallacy to believe arrays
                     <em>
                      are
                     </em>
                     pointers. This is not the case. An array object is a sequence of elements, whereas a pointer object just holds an address.
                     <p>
                      The type information of an array and a decayed array is different. In the example above, the array
                      <code>
                       arr
                      </code>
                      has type
                      <code>
                       int[5]
                      </code>
                      , whereas the decayed array has type
                      <code>
                       int*
                      </code>
                      . Notably, the array type
                      <code>
                       int[5]
                      </code>
                      contains length information, whereas the decayed array pointer type
                      <code>
                       int*
                      </code>
                      does not.

                       <p>
                        Because a C-style arrays decays to a pointer when evaluated, when a C-style array is subscripted, the subscript is actually operating on the decayed array pointer:

int main()
{
    const int arr[] { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

                         </code>
                         directly on a pointer. If that pointer is holding the address of the first element, the result will be identical:
                         <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{

    const int* ptr{ arr };  // arr decays into a pointer

                          We’ll see where this is convenient in a moment, and take a deeper look at how this actually works (as well as what happens when the pointer is holding something other than the address of the first element) in the next lesson

                           <p>
                            Array decay solves both challenges we encountered at the top of the lesson.
                            <p>
                             When passing a C-style array as an argument, the array decays into a pointer, and the pointer holding the address of the first element of the array is what gets passed to the function. So although it looks like we’re passing the C-style array by value, we’re actually passing it by address! This is how making a copy of the C-style array argument is avoided.

                              Now consider two different arrays of the same element type but different lengths (e.g.
                              <code>
                               int[5]
                              </code>
                              and
                              <code>

                              </code>
                              ). These are distinct types, incompatible with each other. However, they will both decay into the same pointer type (e.g.
                              <code>
                               int*
                              </code>
                              ). Their decayed versions are interchangable! Dropping the length information from the type allows us to pass arrays of different lengths without a type mismatch.

                               In the following example, we’ll illustrate two things:

                                 That we can pass arrays of different lengths to a single function (because both decay to the same pointer type).

                                  That our function parameter receiving the array can be a (const) pointer of the array’s element type.

                                  function needs to have a parameter of the same pointer type (

                                    Because a C-style array is passed by address, the function has direct access to the array passed in (not a copy) and can modify its elements. For this reason, it’s a good idea to make sure your function parameter is const if your function does not intend to modify the array elements.

                                        const int arr[]

                                       . However, this has the advantage of communicating to the caller that

                                        arr

                                          A function parameter expecting a C-style array type should use the array syntax (e.g.
                                          <code>
                                           int arr[]
                                          </code>
                                          ) rather than pointer syntax (e.g.
                                          <code>
                                           int *arr
                                          </code>
                                          ).
                                         </p>
                                        </p>
                                       </div>
                                       <p>
                                        The downside of using this syntax is that it makes it less obvious that
                                        <code>
                                         arr

                                        has decayed (whereas it’s quite clear with the pointer syntax), so you’ll need to take extra care not to do anything that doesn’t work as expected with a decayed array (we’ll cover some of these in a moment).

Code that works as expected with a non-decayed array may not compile (or worse, may silently malfunction) when the same code is using a decayed array.

                                                Third, not having length information creates several programmatic challenges. Without length information, it is different to sanity check the length of the array. Users can easily pass in arrays that are shorter than expected (or even pointers to a single value), which will then cause undefined behavior when they are subscripted with an invalid index.

                                                 Not having the array length also create challenges when traversing the array -- how do we know when we’ve reached the end?

                                                  There are solutions to these issues, but these solutions add both complexity and fragility to a program.

                                                    Historically, programmers have worked around the lack of array length information via one of two methods.
                                                    <p>
                                                     First, we can pass in both the array and the array length as separate arguments:

    std::cout &lt;&lt; arr[2] &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

int main()
{
    constexpr int a[]{ 3, 2, 1 };
    printElement2(a, static_cast&lt;int&gt;(std::size(a)));  // ok

    constexpr int b[]{ 7, 6 };
    printElement2(b, static_cast&lt;int&gt;(std::size(b)));  // will trigger assert

                                                      However, this still has a number of issues:
                                                      <ul>
                                                       <li>
                                                        The caller needs to make sure that the array and the array length are paired -- if the wrong value for length is passed in, the function will still malfunction.
                                                        <li>
                                                         There are potential sign conversion issues if you’re using

If our testing path doesn’t cover all calls to the function, there’s a risk of shipping a program to the customer that will assert when they do something we didn’t explicitly test for. In modern C++, we’d want to use

                                                          <li>
                                                           This method only works if we’re making an explicit function call. If the function call is implicit (e.g. we’re calling an operator with the array as an operand), then there’s no opportunity to pass in the length.

                                                       Second, if there is an element value that is not semantically valid (e.g. a test score of

                                                       ), we can instead mark the end of the array using an element of that value. That way, the length of the array can be calculated by counting how many elements exist between the start of the array and this terminating element. The array can also be traversed by iterating from the start until we hit the terminating element. The nice thing about this method is that it works even with implicit function calls.

                                                         <li>
                                                          If the terminating element does not exist, traversal will walk right off the end of the array, causing undefined behavior.
                                                          <li>
                                                           Functions that traverse the array need special handling for the terminating element (e.g. a C-style string print function needs to know not to print the terminating element).

                                                            There is a mismatch between the actual array length and the number of semantically valid elements. If the wrong length is used, the semantically invalid terminating element may be “processed”.
                                                            <li>
                                                             This approach only works if a semantically invalid value exists, which is often not the case.

                                                             In C++, arrays can be passed by reference, in which case the array argument won’t decay when passed to a function (but the reference to the array will still decay when evaluated). However, it’s easy to forget to apply this consistently, and one missed reference will lead to decaying arguments. Also, array reference parameters must have a fixed length, meaning the function can only handle arrays of one particular length. If we want a function that can handle arrays of different lengths, then we also have to use function templates. But if you’re going to do both of those things to “fix” C-style arrays, then you might as well just use

                                                           So when are C-style arrays used in modern C++?
                                                           <p>
                                                            In modern C++, C-style arrays are typically used in two cases:
                                                            <ol start="1">

                                                              To store constexpr global (or constexpr static local) program data. Because such arrays can be accessed directly from anywhere in the program, we do not need to pass the array, which avoids decay-related issues. The syntax for defining C-style arrays can be a little less wonky than
                                                              <code>

                                                              . More importantly, indexing such arrays does not have sign conversion issues like the standard library container classes do.

                                                               ). There are two possible reasons for this: First, converting a non-constexpr C-style string to a

                                                               requires traversing the C-style string to determine its length. If the function is in a performance critical section of code and the length isn’t needed (e.g. because the function is going to traverse the string anyway) then avoiding the conversion may be useful. Second, if the function (or class) calls other functions that expect C-style strings, converting to a
