   The duplicate definition problem
   <p>
    In lesson
    <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/forward-declarations/">
     2.7 -- Forward declarations and definitions
    </a>
    , we noted that a variable or function identifier can only have one definition (the one definition rule). Thus, a program that defines a variable identifier more than once will cause a compile error:
    <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    int x; // this is a definition for variable x
    int x; // compile error: duplicate definition

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
     Similarly, programs that define a function more than once will also cause a compile error:
     <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int foo() // this is a definition for function foo
{
    return 5;
}

int foo() // compile error: duplicate definition
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; foo();
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
     <p>
      While these programs are easy to fix (remove the duplicate definition), with header files, it’s quite easy to end up in a situation where a definition in a header file gets included more than once. This can happen when a header file #includes another header file (which is common).

        Author’s note
        <p>
         In upcoming examples, we’ll define some functions inside header files. You generally shouldn’t do this.
         <p>
          We are doing so here because it is the most effective way to demonstrate some concepts using functionality we’ve already covered.

       Consider the following academic example:
       <p>
        square.h:
        <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int getSquareSides()
{
    return 4;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
         wave.h:
         <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include "square.h"</code></pre>
         <p>
          main.cpp:
          <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include "square.h"
#include "wave.h"

int main()
{
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
           This seemingly innocent looking program won’t compile! Here’s what’s happening. First,
           <em>
            main.cpp
           </em>
           #includes
           <em>
            square.h
           </em>
           , which copies the definition for function
           <em>
            getSquareSides
           </em>
           into
           <em>
            main.cpp
           </em>
           . Then
           <em>
            main.cpp
           </em>
           #includes
           <em>
            wave.h
           </em>
           , which #includes
           <em>
            square.h
           </em>
           itself. This copies contents of
           <em>
            square.h
           </em>
           (including the definition for function
           <em>
            getSquareSides
           </em>
           ) into
           <em>
            wave.h
           </em>
           , which then gets copied into
           <em>
            main.cpp
           </em>
           .
           <p>
            Thus, after resolving all of the #includes,
            <em>
             main.cpp
            </em>
            ends up looking like this:
            <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int getSquareSides()  // from square.h
{
    return 4;
}

int getSquareSides() // from wave.h (via square.h)
{
    return 4;
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
             Duplicate definitions and a compile error. Each file, individually, is fine. However, because
             <em>
              main.cpp
             </em>
             ends up #including the content of
             <em>
              square.h
             </em>
             twice, we’ve run into problems. If
             <em>
              wave.h
             </em>
             needs
             <em>
              getSquareSides()
             </em>
             , and
             <em>
              main.cpp
             </em>
             needs both
             <em>
              wave.h
             </em>
             and
             <em>
              square.h
             </em>
             , how would you resolve this issue?
             <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
              Header guards
              <p>
               The good news is that we can avoid the above problem via a mechanism called a
               <strong>
                header guard
               </strong>
               (also called an
               <strong>
                include guard
               </strong>
               ). Header guards are conditional compilation directives that take the following form:
               <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
#define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE

// your declarations (and certain types of definitions) here

#endif</code></pre>
               <p>
                When this header is #included, the preprocessor will check whether
                <em>
                 SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
                </em>
                has been previously defined in this translation unit. If this is the first time we’re including the header,
                <em>
                 SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
                </em>
                will not have been defined. Consequently, it #defines
                <em>
                 SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
                </em>
                and includes the contents of the file. If the header is included again into the same file,
                <em>
                 SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
                </em>
                will already have been defined from the first time the contents of the header were included, and the contents of the header will be ignored (thanks to the #ifndef).
                <p>
                 All of your header files should have header guards on them.
                 <em>
                  SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
                 </em>
                 can be any name you want, but by convention is set to the full filename of the header file, typed in all caps, using underscores for spaces or punctuation. For example,
                 <em>
                  square.h
                 </em>
                 would have the header guard:
                 <p>
                  square.h:
                  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#ifndef SQUARE_H
#define SQUARE_H

int getSquareSides()
{
    return 4;
}

#endif</code></pre>
                  <p>
                   Even the standard library headers use header guards. If you were to take a look at the iostream header file from Visual Studio, you would see:
                   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#ifndef _IOSTREAM_
#define _IOSTREAM_

// content here

#endif</code></pre>

                     For advanced readers
                     <p>
                      In large programs, it’s possible to have two separate header files (included from different directories) that end up having the same filename (e.g. directoryA\config.h and directoryB\config.h). If only the filename is used for the include guard (e.g. CONFIG_H), these two files may end up using the same guard name. If that happens, any file that includes (directly or indirectly) both config.h files will not receive the contents of the include file to be included second. This will probably cause a compilation error.
                      <p>
                       Because of this possibility for guard name conflicts, many developers recommend using a more complex/unique name in your header guards. Some good suggestions are a naming convention of PROJECT_PATH_FILE_H, FILE_LARGE-RANDOM-NUMBER_H, or FILE_CREATION-DATE_H.

                           <p>
                            First, the preprocessor evaluates
                            <code>
                             #ifndef SQUARE_H

                              Header guards prevent duplicate inclusions because the first time a guard is encountered, the guard macro isn’t defined, so the guarded content is included. Past that point, the guard macro is defined, so any subsequent copies of the guarded content are excluded.

                                            Can’t we just avoid definitions in header files?
                                            <p>
                                             We’ve generally told you not to include function definitions in your headers. So you may be wondering why you should include header guards if they protect you from something you shouldn’t do.
                                             <p>
                                              There are quite a few cases we’ll show you in the future where it’s necessary to put non-function definitions in a header file. For example, C++ will let you create your own types. These custom types are typically defined in header files, so the type definitions can be propagated out to the code files that need to use them. Without a header guard, a code file could end up with multiple (identical) copies of a given type definition, which the compiler will flag as an error.
                                              <p>
                                               So even though it’s not strictly necessary to have header guards at this point in the tutorial series, we’re establishing good habits now, so you don’t have to unlearn bad habits later.

                                                     There is one known case where

                                                     will typically fail. If a header file is copied so that it exists in multiple places on the file system, if somehow both copies of the header get included, header guards will successfully de-dupe the identical headers, but

                                                     won’t (because the compiler won’t realize they are actually identical content).

For this reason, some development houses (such as Google) recommend using traditional header guards. In this tutorial series, we will favor header guards, as they are the most conventional way to guard headers. However, support for

                                                      Header guards are designed to ensure that the contents of a given header file are not copied more than once into any single file, in order to prevent duplicate definitions.
                                                      <p>

                                                       </em>
                                                       are fine -- but even if your header file is composed of all declarations (no definitions) it’s still a best practice to include header guards.
                                                       <p>
                                                        Note that header guards do
                                                        <em>

                                                        prevent the contents of a header file from being copied (once) into separate project files. This is a good thing, because we often need to reference the contents of a given header from different project files.
