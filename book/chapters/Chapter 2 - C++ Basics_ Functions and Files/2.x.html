    A
    <strong>
     function
    </strong>
    is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job. Functions you write yourself are called
    <strong>
     user-defined
    </strong>
    functions.
    <p>
     A
     <strong>
      function call
     </strong>
     is an expression that tells the CPU to execute a function. The function initiating the function call is the
     <strong>
      caller
     </strong>
     , and the function being called is the
     <strong>
      callee
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      called
     </strong>
     function. Do not forget to include parenthesis when making a function call.
     <p>
      The curly braces and statements in a function definition are called the
      <strong>
       function body
      </strong>
      .
      <p>
       A function that returns a value is called a
       <strong>
        value-returning function
       </strong>
       . The
       <strong>
        return type
       </strong>
       of a function indicates the type of value that the function will return. The
       <strong>
        return statement
       </strong>
       determines the specific
       <strong>
        return value
       </strong>
       that is returned to the caller. A return value is copied from the function back to the caller -- this process is called
       <strong>
        return by value
       </strong>
       . Failure to return a value from a non-void function will result in undefined behavior.
       <p>
        The return value from function
        <em>
         main
        </em>
        is called a
        <strong>
         status code
        </strong>
        , and it tells the operating system (and any other programs that called yours) whether your program executed successfully or not. By consensus a return value of 0 means success, and a non-zero return value means failure.
        <p>
         Practice
         <strong>
          DRY
         </strong>
         programming -- “don’t repeat yourself”. Make use of variables and functions to remove redundant code.
         <p>
          Functions with a return type of
          <strong>
           void
          </strong>
          do not return a value to the caller. A function that does not return a value is called a
          <strong>
           void function
          </strong>
          or
          <strong>
           non-value returning function
          </strong>
          . Void functions can’t be called where a value is required.
          <p>
           A return statement that is not the last statement in a function is called an
           <strong>
            early return
           </strong>
           . Such a statement causes the function to return to the caller immediately.
           <p>
            A
            <strong>
             function parameter
            </strong>
            is a variable used in a function where the value is provided by the caller of the function. An
            <strong>
             argument
            </strong>
            is the specific value passed from the caller to the function. When an argument is copied into the parameter, this is called
            <strong>
             pass by value
            </strong>
            .
            <p>
             Function parameters and variables defined inside the function body are called
             <strong>
              local variables
             </strong>
             . The time in which a variable exists is called its
             <strong>
              lifetime
             </strong>
             . Variables are created and destroyed at
             <strong>
              runtime
             </strong>
             , which is when the program is running. A variable’s
             <strong>
              scope
             </strong>
             determines where it can be seen and used. When a variable can be seen and used, we say it is
             <strong>
              in scope
             </strong>
             . When it can not be seen, it can not be used, and we say it is
             <strong>
              out of scope
             </strong>
             . Scope is a
             <strong>
              compile-time
             </strong>
             property, meaning it is enforced at compile time.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Whitespace
              </strong>
              refers to characters used for formatting purposes. In C++, this includes spaces, tabs, and newlines.
              <p>
               A
               <strong>
                forward declaration
               </strong>
               allows us to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier before actually defining the identifier. To write a forward declaration for a function, we use a
               <strong>
                function prototype
               </strong>
               , which includes the function’s return type, name, and parameters, but no function body, followed by a semicolon.
               <p>
                A
                <strong>
                 definition
                </strong>
                actually implements (for functions and types) or instantiates (for variables) an identifier. A
                <strong>
                 declaration
                </strong>
                is a statement that tells the compiler about the existence of the identifier. In C++, all definitions serve as declarations.
                <strong>
                 Pure declarations
                </strong>
                are declarations that are not also definitions (such as function prototypes).
                <p>
                 Most non-trivial programs contain multiple files.
                 <p>
                  When two identifiers are introduced into the same program in a way that the compiler or linker can’t tell them apart, the compiler or linker will error due to a
                  <strong>
                   naming collision
                  </strong>
                  . A
                  <strong>
                   namespace
                  </strong>
                  guarantees that all identifiers within the namespace are unique. The std namespace is one such namespace.
                  <p>
                   The
                   <strong>
                    preprocessor
                   </strong>
                   is a process that runs on the code before it is compiled.
                   <strong>
                    Directives
                   </strong>
                   are special instructions to the preprocessor. Directives start with a # symbol and end with a newline. A
                   <strong>
                    macro
                   </strong>
                   is a rule that defines how input text is converted to a replacement output text.
                   <p>
                    <strong>
                     Header files
                    </strong>
                    are files designed to propagate declarations to code files. When using the
                    <em>
                     #include
                    </em>
                    directive, the
                    <em>
                     #include
                    </em>
                    directive is replaced by the contents of the included file. When including headers, use angled brackets when including system headers (e.g. those in the C++ standard library), and use double quotes when including user-defined headers (the ones you write). When including system headers, include the versions with no .h extension if they exist.
                    <p>
                     <strong>
                      Header guards
                     </strong>
                     prevent the contents of a header from being included more than once into a given code file. They do not prevent the contents of a header from being included into multiple different code files.

                         Question #1
                         <p>
                          Write a single-file program (named main.cpp) that reads two separate integers from the user, adds them together, and then outputs the answer. The program should use three functions:
                          <ul>
                           <li>
                            A function named “readNumber” should be used to get (and return) a single integer from the user.
                            <li>
                             A function named “writeAnswer” should be used to output the answer. This function should take a single parameter and have no return value.
                             <li>
                              A main() function should be used to glue the above functions together.
                             </li>
                            </li>
