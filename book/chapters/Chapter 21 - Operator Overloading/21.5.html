    21.2 -- Overloading the arithmetic operators using friend functions
   </a>
   , you learned how to overload the arithmetic operators using friend functions.  You also learned you can overload operators as normal functions.  Many operators can be overloaded in a different way: as a member function.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overloading operators using a member function is very similar to overloading operators using a friend function.  When overloading an operator using a member function:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The overloaded operator must be added as a member function of the left operand.
   </li>
   <li>
    The left operand becomes the implicit *this object
   </li>
   <li>
    All other operands become function parameters.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   As a reminder, here’s how we overloaded operator+ using a friend function:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Cents
{
private:
    int m_cents {};

public:
    Cents(int cents)
        : m_cents { cents } { }

    // Overload Cents + int
    friend Cents operator+(const Cents&amp; cents, int value);

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: this function is not a member function!
Cents operator+(const Cents&amp; cents, int value)
{
    return Cents(cents.m_cents + value);
}

int main()
{
	const Cents cents1 { 6 };
	const Cents cents2 { cents1 + 2 };
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "I have " &lt;&lt; cents2.getCents() &lt;&lt; " cents.\n";
 
	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Converting a friend overloaded operator to a member overloaded operator is easy:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The overloaded operator is defined as a member instead of a friend (Cents::operator+ instead of friend operator+)
   </li>
   <li>
    The left parameter is removed, because that parameter now becomes the implicit *this object.
   </li>
   <li>
    Inside the function body, all references to the left parameter can be removed (e.g. cents.m_cents becomes m_cents, which implicitly references the *this object).
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Now, the same operator overloaded using the member function method:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Cents
{
private:
    int m_cents {};

public:
    Cents(int cents)
        : m_cents { cents } { }

    // Overload Cents + int
    Cents operator+(int value) const;

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: this function is a member function!
// the cents parameter in the friend version is now the implicit *this parameter
Cents Cents::operator+ (int value) const
{
    return Cents { m_cents + value };
}

int main()
{
	const Cents cents1 { 6 };
	const Cents cents2 { cents1 + 2 };
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "I have " &lt;&lt; cents2.getCents() &lt;&lt; " cents.\n";
 
	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Note that the usage of the operator does not change (in both cases,
   <code>
    cents1 + 2
   </code>
   ), we’ve simply defined the function differently.  Our two-parameter friend function becomes a one-parameter member function, with the leftmost parameter in the friend version (cents) becoming the implicit *this parameter in the member function version.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s take a closer look at how the expression
   <code>
    cents1 + 2
   </code>
   evaluates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the friend function version, the expression
   <code>
    cents1 + 2
   </code>
   becomes function call operator+(cents1, 2).  Note that there are two function parameters.  This is straightforward.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the member function version, the expression
   <code>
    cents1 + 2
   </code>
   becomes function call
   <code>
    cents1.operator+(2)
   </code>
   .  Note that there is now only one explicit function parameter, and cents1 has become an object prefix.  However, in lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/the-hidden-this-pointer-and-member-function-chaining/">
    15.1 -- The hidden “this” pointer and member function chaining
   </a>
   , we mentioned that the compiler implicitly converts an object prefix into a hidden leftmost parameter named *this.  So in actuality,
   <code>
    cents1.operator+(2)
   </code>
   becomes
   <code>
    operator+(&amp;​cents1, 2)
   </code>
   , which is almost identical to the friend version.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both cases produce the same result, just in slightly different ways.
  </p>
  <p>
   So if we can overload an operator as a friend or a member, which should we use?  In order to answer that question, there’s a few more things you’ll need to know.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Not everything can be overloaded as a friend function
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The assignment (=), subscript ([]), function call (()), and member selection (-&gt;) operators must be overloaded as member functions, because the language requires them to be.

    21.4 -- Overloading the I/O operators
   </a>
   , we overloaded operator&lt;&lt; for our Point class using the friend function method.  Here’s a reminder of how we did that:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
class Point
{
private:
    double m_x {};
    double m_y {};
    double m_z {};
 
public:
    Point(double x=0.0, double y=0.0, double z=0.0)
        : m_x { x }, m_y { y }, m_z { z }
    {
    }
 
    friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; out, const Point&amp; point);
};
 
std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; out, const Point&amp; point)
{
    // Since operator&lt;&lt; is a friend of the Point class, we can access Point's members directly.
    out &lt;&lt; "Point(" &lt;&lt; point.m_x &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; point.m_y &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; point.m_z &lt;&lt; ")";
 
    return out;
}
 
int main()
{
    Point point1 { 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 };
 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; point1;
 
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   However, we are not able to overload operator&lt;&lt; as a member function.  Why not?  Because the overloaded operator must be added as a member of the left operand.  In this case, the left operand is an object of type std::ostream.  std::ostream is fixed as part of the standard library.  We can’t modify the class declaration to add the overload as a member function of std::ostream.
  </p>
  <p>
   This necessitates that operator&lt;&lt; be overloaded as a normal function (preferred) or a friend.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similarly, although we can overload operator+(Cents, int) as a member function (as we did above), we can’t overload operator+(int, Cents) as a member function, because int isn’t a class we can add members to.
  </p>
  <p>
   Typically, we won’t be able to use a member overload if the left operand is either not a class (e.g. int), or it is a class that we can’t modify (e.g. std::ostream).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    When to use a normal, friend, or member function overload
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   In most cases, the language leaves it up to you to determine whether you want to use the normal/friend or member function version of the overload.  However, one of the two is usually a better choice than the other.
  </p>
  <p>
   When dealing with binary operators that don’t modify the left operand (e.g. operator+), the normal or friend function version is typically preferred, because it works for all parameter types (even when the left operand isn’t a class object, or is a class that is not modifiable).  The normal or friend function version has the added benefit of “symmetry”, as all operands become explicit parameters (instead of the left operand becoming *this and the right operand becoming an explicit parameter).
  </p>
  <p>
   When dealing with binary operators that do modify the left operand (e.g. operator+=), the member function version is typically preferred.  In these cases, the leftmost operand will always be a class type, and having the object being modified become the one pointed to by *this is natural.  Because the rightmost operand becomes an explicit parameter, there’s no confusion over who is getting modified and who is getting evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unary operators are usually overloaded as member functions as well, since the member version has no parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following rules of thumb can help you determine which form is best for a given situation:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    If you’re overloading assignment (=), subscript ([]), function call (()), or member selection (-&gt;), do so as a member function.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you’re overloading a unary operator, do so as a member function.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you’re overloading a binary operator that does not modify its left operand (e.g. operator+), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand, but you can’t add members to the class definition of the left operand (e.g. operator&lt;&lt;, which has a left operand of type ostream), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand (e.g. operator+=), and you can modify the definition of the left operand, do so as a member function.
   </li>
  </ul>
