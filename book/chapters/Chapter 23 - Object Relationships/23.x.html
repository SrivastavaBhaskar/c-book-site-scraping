   In this chapter, we learned about some different kinds of relationships between two objects.
   <p>
    <strong>
     Summary
    </strong>
    <p>
     The process of building complex objects from simpler ones is called
     <strong>
      object composition
     </strong>
     . There are two types of object composition: composition, and aggregation.
     <p>
      <strong>
       Composition
      </strong>
      exists when a member of a class has a part-of relationship with the class. In a composition relationship, the class manages the existence of the members. To qualify as a
      <strong>
       composition
      </strong>
      , an object and a part must have the following relationship:
      <ul>
       <li>
        The part (member) is part of the object (class)
        <li>
         The part (member) can only belong to one object (class) at a time
         <li>
          The part (member) has its existence managed by the object (class)
          <li>
           The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)
          </li>
         </li>
        </li>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Compositions are typically implemented via normal member variables, or by pointers where the class manages all the memory allocation and deallocation. If you can implement a class as a composition, you should implement a class as a composition.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Aggregations
        </strong>
        exists when a class has a has-a relationship with the member. In an aggregation relationship, the class does not manage the existence of the members. To qualify as an
        <strong>
         aggregation
        </strong>
        , an object and its parts must have the following relationship:
        <ul>
         <li>
          The part (member) is part of the object (class)
          <li>
           The part (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time
           <li>
            The part (member) does
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            have its existence managed by the object (class)
            <li>
             The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)
            </li>
           </li>
          </li>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Aggregations are typically implemented via pointer or reference.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Associations
          </strong>
          are a looser type of relationship, where the class uses-an otherwise unrelated object. To qualify as an
          <strong>
           association
          </strong>
          , an object and an associated object must have the following relationship:
          <ul>
           <li>
            The associated object (member) is otherwise unrelated to the object (class)
            <li>
             The associated object (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time
             <li>
              The associated object (member) does
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              have its existence managed by the object (class)
              <li>
               The associated object (member) may or may not know about the existence of the object (class)
              </li>
             </li>
            </li>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Associations may be implemented via pointer or reference, or by a more indirect means (such as holding the index or key of the associated object).
           <p>
            In a
            <strong>
             dependency
            </strong>
            , one class uses another class to perform a task. The dependent class typically is not a member of the class using it, but rather is temporarily created, used, and then destroyed, or passed into a member function from an external source.
            <p>
             In a
             <strong>
              container class
             </strong>
             one class provides a container to hold multiple objects of another type. A
             <strong>
              value container
             </strong>
             is a composition that stores copies of the objects it is holding. A
             <strong>
              reference container
             </strong>
             is an aggregation that stores pointers or references to objects that live outside the container.
             <p>
              std::initializer_list can be used to implement constructors, assignment operators, and other functions that accept a list initialization parameter. std::initializer_list lives in the &lt;initializer_list&gt; header.
