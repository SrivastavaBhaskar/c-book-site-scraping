   Consider the following program that makes use of a virtual function:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Base";  }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	void print() const override { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Derived"; }
};

int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base&amp; b{ d };
	b.print(); // will call Derived::print()

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   By now, you should be comfortable with the fact that b.print() will call Derived::print() (because b is referencing a Derived class object, Base::print() is a virtual function, and Derived::print() is an override).
  </p>
  <p>
   While calling member functions like this to do output is okay, this style of function doesn’t mix well with std::cout:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base&amp; b{ d };

	std::cout &lt;&lt; "b is a ";
	b.print(); // messy, we have to break our print statement to call this function
	std::cout &lt;&lt; '\n';

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In this lesson, we’ll look at how to override operator&lt;&lt; for classes using inheritance, so that we can use operator&lt;&lt; as expected, like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">std::cout &lt;&lt; "b is a " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; '\n'; // much better</code></pre>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   The challenges with operator&lt;&lt;
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s start by overloading operator&lt;&lt; in the typical way:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Base"; }

	friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const Base&amp; b)
	{
		out &lt;&lt; "Base";
		return out;
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	void print() const override { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Derived"; }

	friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const Derived&amp; d)
	{
		out &lt;&lt; "Derived";
		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; '\n';

	Derived d{};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; '\n';

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Because there is no need for virtual function resolution here, this program works as we’d expect, and prints:
  </p>
  <pre>Base
Derived
</pre>
  <p>
   Now, consider the following main() function instead:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    Derived d{};
    Base&amp; bref{ d };
    std::cout &lt;&lt; bref &lt;&lt; '\n';
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This program prints:
  </p>
  <pre>Base
</pre>
  <p>
   That’s probably not what we were expecting.  This happens because our version of operator&lt;&lt; that handles Base objects isn’t virtual, so std::cout &lt;&lt; bref calls the version of operator&lt;&lt; that handles Base objects rather than Derived objects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therein lies the challenge.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Can we make operator&lt;&lt; virtual?
  </p>
  <p>
   If this issue is that operator&lt;&lt; isn’t virtual, can’t we simply make it virtual?
  </p>
  <p>
   The short answer is no.  There are a number of reasons for this.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, only member functions can be virtualized -- this makes sense, since only classes can inherit from other classes, and there’s no way to override a function that lives outside of a class (you can overload non-member functions, but not override them).  Because we typically implement operator&lt;&lt; as a friend, and friends aren’t considered member functions, a friend version of operator&lt;&lt; is ineligible to be virtualized.  (For a review of why we implement operator&lt;&lt; this way, please revisit lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/overloading-operators-using-member-functions/">
    21.5 -- Overloading operators using member functions
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, even if we could virtualize operator&lt;&lt; there’s the problem that the function parameters for Base::operator&lt;&lt; and Derived::operator&lt;&lt; differ (the Base version would take a Base parameter and the Derived version would take a Derived parameter).  Consequently, the Derived version wouldn’t be considered an override of the Base version, and thus be ineligible for virtual function resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
   So what’s a programmer to do?
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   A solution
  </p>
  <p>
   The answer, as it turns out, is surprisingly simple.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, we set up
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   as a friend in our base class as usual.  But rather than have
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   determine what to print, we will instead have it call a normal member function that
   <em>
    can
   </em>
   be virtualized!  This virtual function will do the work of determining what to print for each class.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this first solution, our virtual member function (which we call
   <code>
    identify()
   </code>
   ) returns a
   <code>
    std::string
   </code>
   , which is printed by
   <code>
    Base::operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   :
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator&lt;&lt;
	friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const Base&amp; b)
	{
		// Call virtual function identify() to get the string to be printed
		out &lt;&lt; b.identify();
		return out;
	}

	// We'll rely on member function identify() to return the string to be printed
	// Because identify() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::string identify() const
	{
		return "Base";
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	// Here's our override identify() function to handle the Derived case
	std::string identify() const override
	{
		return "Derived";
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; '\n';

	Derived d{};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator&lt;&lt; that explicitly handles Derived objects

	Base&amp; bref{ d };
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bref &lt;&lt; '\n';

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This prints the expected result:
  </p>
  <pre>Base
Derived
Derived
</pre>
  <p>
   Let’s examine how this works in more detail.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the case of
   <code>
    Base b
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   is called with parameter
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   referencing the Base object.  Virtual function call
   <code>
    b.identify()
   </code>
   thus resolves to
   <code>
    Base::identify()
   </code>
   , which returns “Base” to be printed.  Nothing too special here.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the case of
   <code>
    Derived d
   </code>
   , the compiler first looks to see if there’s an
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   that takes a Derived object.  There isn’t one, because we didn’t define one.  Next the compiler looks to see if there’s an
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   that takes a Base object.  There is, so the compiler does an implicit upcast of our Derived object to a Base&amp; and calls the function (we could have done this upcast ourselves, but the compiler is helpful in this regard).  Because parameter
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   is referencing a Derived object, virtual function call
   <code>
    b.identify()
   </code>
   resolves to
   <code>
    Derived::identify()
   </code>
   , which returns “Derived” to be printed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that we don’t need to define an
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   for each derived class!  The version that handles Base objects works just fine for both Base objects and any class derived from Base!
  </p>
  <p>
   The third case proceeds as a mix of the first two.  First, the compiler matches variable bref with
   <code>
    operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   that takes a Base reference.  Because parameter
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   is referencing a Derived object,
   <code>
    b.identify()
   </code>
   resolves to
   <code>
    Derived::identify()
   </code>
   , which returns “Derived”.
  </p>
  <p>
   Problem solved.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   A more flexible solution
  </p>
  <p>
   The above solution works great, but has two potential shortcomings:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    It makes the assumption that the desired output can be represented as a single std::string.
   </li>
   <li>
    Our
    <code>
     identify()
    </code>
    member function does not have access to the stream object.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   The latter is problematic in cases where we need a stream object, such as when we want to print the value of a member variable that has an overloaded operator&lt;&lt;.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortunately, it’s straightforward to modify the above example to resolve both of these issues.  In the previous version, virtual function
   <code>
    identify()
   </code>
   returned a string to be printed by
   <code>
    Base::operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   .  In this version, we’ll instead define virtual member function
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   and delegate responsibility for printing
   <em>
    directly
   </em>
   to that function.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s an example that illustrates the idea:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator&lt;&lt;
	friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const Base&amp; b)
	{
		// Delegate printing responsibility for printing to virtual member function print()
		return b.print(out);
	}

	// We'll rely on member function print() to do the actual printing
	// Because print() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::ostream&amp; print(std::ostream&amp; out) const
	{
		out &lt;&lt; "Base";
		return out;
	}
};

// Some class or struct with an overloaded operator&lt;&lt;
struct Employee
{
	std::string name{};
	int id{};

	friend std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out, const Employee&amp; e)
	{
		out &lt;&lt; "Employee(" &lt;&lt; e.name &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; e.id &lt;&lt; ")";
		return out;
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
private:
	Employee m_e{}; // Derived now has an Employee member

public:
	Derived(const Employee&amp; e)
		: m_e{ e }
	{
	}

	// Here's our override print() function to handle the Derived case
	std::ostream&amp; print(std::ostream&amp; out) const override
	{
		out &lt;&lt; "Derived: ";

		// Print the Employee member using the stream object
		out &lt;&lt; m_e;

		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; '\n';

	Derived d{ Employee{"Jim", 4}};
	std::cout &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator&lt;&lt; that explicitly handles Derived objects

	Base&amp; bref{ d };
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bref &lt;&lt; '\n';

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This outputs:
  </p>
  <pre>Base
Derived: Employee(Jim, 4)
Derived: Employee(Jim, 4)
</pre>
  <p>
   In this version,
   <code>
    Base::operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   doesn’t do any printing itself.  Instead, it just calls virtual member function
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   and passes it the stream object.  The
   <code>
    print()
   </code>
   function then uses this stream object to do its own printing.
   <code>
    Base::print()
   </code>
   uses the stream object to print “Base”.  More interestingly,
   <code>
    Derived::print()
   </code>
   uses the stream object to print both “Derived: ” and to call
   <code>
    Employee::operator&lt;&lt;
   </code>
   to print the value of member
   <code>
    m_e
   </code>
   .  The latter would have been more challenging to do in the prior example!
