   An

      The key difference between the various integer types is that they have varying sizes -- the larger integers can hold bigger numbers.

        A reminder
        <p>
         C++ only guarantees that integers will have a certain minimum size, not that they will have a specific size. See lesson

         Technically, the
         <code>
          bool
         </code>
         and
         <code>
          char
         </code>
         types are considered to be integral types (because these types store their values as integer values). For the purpose of the next few lessons, we’ll exclude these types from our discussion.

       Signed integers
       <p>
        When writing negative numbers in everyday life, we use a negative sign. For example,
        <em>
         -3
        </em>
        means “negative 3”. We’d also typically recognize
        <em>
         +3
        </em>
        as “positive 3” (though common convention dictates that we typically omit plus prefixes).
        <p>
         This attribute of being positive, negative, or zero is called the number’s
         <strong>
          sign
         </strong>
         .
         <p>
          By default, integers in C++ are
          <strong>
           signed
          </strong>
          , which means the number’s sign is stored as part of the value. Therefore, a signed integer can hold both positive and negative numbers (and 0).
          <p>
           In this lesson, we’ll focus on signed integers. We’ll discuss unsigned integers (which can only hold non-negative numbers) in the next lesson.
           <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
            Defining signed integers
            <p>
             Here is the preferred way to define the four types of signed integers:
             <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">short s;      // prefer "short" instead of "short int"
int i;
long l;       // prefer "long" instead of "long int"
long long ll; // prefer "long long" instead of "long long int"</code></pre>
             <p>
              Although
              <em>
               short int
              </em>
              ,
              <em>
               long int
              </em>
              , or
              <em>
               long long int
              </em>
              will work, we prefer the short names for these types (that do not use the
              <em>
               int
              </em>
              suffix). In addition to being more typing, adding the
              <em>
               int
              </em>
              suffix makes the type harder to distinguish from variables of type
              <em>
               int
              </em>
              . This can lead to mistakes if the short or long modifier is inadvertently missed.
              <p>
               The integer types can also take an optional
               <em>
                signed
               </em>
               keyword, which by convention is typically placed before the type name:
               <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">signed short ss;
signed int si;
signed long sl;
signed long long sll;</code></pre>
               <p>
                However, this keyword should not be used, as it is redundant, since integers are signed by default.

                 <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
                  Best practice
                  <p>
                   Prefer the shorthand types that do not use the
                   <code>
                    int
                   </code>
                   suffix or

                    signed
                   </code>
                   prefix.

                 Signed integer ranges
                 <p>
                  As you learned in the last section, a variable with
                  <em>
                   n
                  </em>
                  bits can hold 2
                  <sup>
                   n
                  </sup>
                  possible values. But which specific values? We call the set of specific values that a data type can hold its
                  <strong>
                   range
                  </strong>
                  . The range of an integer variable is determined by two factors: its size (in bits), and whether it is signed or not.
                  <p>
                   For example, an 8-bit signed integer has a range of -128 to 127. This means an 8-bit signed integer can store any integer value between -128 and 127 (inclusive) safely.

                        to an 8-bit signed integer? This number is outside the range that an 8-bit signed integer can hold. The number 140 requires 9 bits to represent (8 magnitude bits and 1 sign bit), but we only have 8 bits (7 magnitude bits and 1 sign bit) available in an 8-bit signed integer.

                                When dividing two integers, C++ works like you’d expect when the quotient is a whole number:

                                 This produces the expected result:

                                  But let’s look at what happens when integer division causes a fractional result:
                                  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

                                  <p>
                                   This produces a possibly unexpected result:

                                    ), C++ always produces an integer result. Since integers can’t hold fractional values, any fractional portion is simply dropped (not rounded!).
                                    <p>
                                     Taking a closer look at the above example, 8 / 5 produces the value 1.6. The fractional part (0.6) is dropped, and the result of 1 remains. Alternatively, we can say 8 / 5 equals 1 remainder 3. The remainder is dropped, leaving 1.
                                     <p>
                                      Similarly, -8 / 5 results in the value -1.

                                         Be careful when using integer division, as you will lose any fractional parts of the quotient. However, if it’s what you want, integer division is safe to use, as the results are predictable.

                                              Another way to think about this: 1 of the 5 bits is required to hold the sign. That leaves 4 bits for the magnitude. With 4 bits, we have 16 unique values available. On the negative side, these magnitude bits represent values -1 to -16. On the non-negative side, these magnitude bits represent values 0 to 15. The non-negative side has one less value of range because it includes 0.
