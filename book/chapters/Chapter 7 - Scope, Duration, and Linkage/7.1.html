   A
   <strong>
    compound statement
   </strong>
   (also called a
   <strong>
    block
   </strong>
   , or
   <strong>
    block statement
   </strong>
   ) is a group of
   <em>
    zero or more statements
   </em>
   that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement.
   <p>
    Blocks begin with a
    <code>
     {
    </code>
    symbol, end with a
    <code>
     }
    </code>
    symbol, with the statements to be executed being placed in between. Blocks can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. No semicolon is needed at the end of a block.
    <p>
     You have already seen an example of blocks when writing functions, as the function body is a block:
     <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int add(int x, int y)
{ // start block
    return x + y;
} // end block (no semicolon)

int main()
{ // start block

    // multiple statements
    int value {}; // this is initialization, not a block
    add(3, 4);

    return 0;

} // end block (no semicolon)</code></pre>
     <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
      Blocks inside other blocks
      <p>
       Although functions can’t be nested inside other functions, blocks
       <em>
        can be
       </em>
       nested inside other blocks:
       <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int add(int x, int y)
{ // block
    return x + y;
} // end block

int main()
{ // outer block

    // multiple statements
    int value {};

    { // inner/nested block
        add(3, 4);
    } // end inner/nested block

    return 0;

} // end outer block</code></pre>
       <p>
        When blocks are nested, the enclosing block is typically called the
        <strong>
         outer block
        </strong>
        and the enclosed block is called the
        <strong>
         inner block
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         nested block
        </strong>
        .
        <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both">
         Using blocks to execute multiple statements conditionally
         <p>
          One of the most common use cases for blocks is in conjunction with
          <code>
           if statements
          </code>
          . By default, an
          <code>
           if statement
          </code>
          executes a single statement if the condition evaluates to
          <code>
           true
          </code>
          . However, we can replace this single statement with a block of statements if we want multiple statements to execute when the condition evaluates to
          <code>
           true
          </code>
          .
          <p>
           For example:
           <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{ // start of outer block
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter an integer: ";
    int value {};
    std::cin &gt;&gt; value;
    
    if (value &gt;= 0)
    { // start of nested block
        std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; " is a positive integer (or zero)\n";
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Double this number is " &lt;&lt; value * 2 &lt;&lt; '\n';
    } // end of nested block
    else
    { // start of another nested block
        std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; " is a negative integer\n";
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "The positive of this number is " &lt;&lt; -value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    } // end of another nested block

    return 0;
} // end of outer block</code></pre>
           <p>
            If the user enters the number 3, this program prints:
            <pre>Enter an integer: 3
3 is a positive integer (or zero)
Double this number is 6
</pre>
            <p>
             If the user enters the number -4, this program prints:
             <pre>Enter an integer: -4
-4 is a negative integer
The positive of this number is 4
</pre>

              Block nesting levels
              <p>
               It is even possible to put blocks inside of blocks inside of blocks:
               <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{ // block 1, nesting level 1
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter an integer: ";
    int value {};
    std::cin &gt;&gt; value;
    
    if (value &gt;  0)
    { // block 2, nesting level 2
        if ((value % 2) == 0)
        { // block 3, nesting level 3
            std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; " is positive and even\n";
        }
        else
        { // block 4, also nesting level 3
            std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; " is positive and odd\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
               <p>
                The
                <strong>
                 nesting level
                </strong>
                (also called the
                <strong>
                 nesting depth
                </strong>
                ) of a function is the maximum number of nested blocks you can be inside at any point in the function (including the outer block). In the above function, there are 4 blocks, but the nesting level is 3 since in this program you can never be inside more than 3 blocks at any point.
                <p>
                 The C++ standard says that C++ compilers should support 256 levels of nesting -- however not all do (e.g. as of the time of writing, Visual Studio supports fewer).
                 <p>
                  It’s a good idea to keep your nesting level to 3 or less. Just as overly-long functions are good candidates for refactoring (breaking into smaller functions), overly-nested blocks are hard to read and are good candidates for refactoring (with the most-nested blocks becoming separate functions).

                    Best practice
                    <p>
                     Keep the nesting level of your functions to 3 or less. If your function has a need for more nested levels, consider refactoring your function into sub-functions.
