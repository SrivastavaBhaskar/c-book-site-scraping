   </p>
  </div>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   A short history lesson
  </p>
  <p>
   Back before C++ had support for namespaces, all of the names that are now in the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace were in the global namespace.  This caused naming collisions between program identifiers and standard library identifiers.  Programs that worked under one version of C++ might have a naming conflict with a newer version of C++.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995, namespaces were standardized, and all of the functionality from the standard library was moved out of the global namespace and into namespace
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   .  This change broke older code that was still using names without
   <code>
    std::
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As anyone who has worked on a large codebase knows, any change to a codebase (no matter how trivial) risks breaking the program.  Updating every name that was now moved into the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace to use the
   <code>
    std::
   </code>
   prefix was a massive risk.  A solution was requested.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fast forward to today -- if you’re using the standard library a lot, typing
   <code>
    std::
   </code>
   before everything you use from the standard library can become repetitive, and in some cases, can make your code harder to read.
  </p>
  <p>
   C++ provides some solutions to both of these problems, in the form of using-statements.
  </p>
  <p>
   But first, let’s define two terms.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Qualified and unqualified names
  </p>
  <p>
   A name can be either qualified or unqualified.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <strong>
    qualified name
   </strong>
   is a name that includes an associated scope.  Most often, names are qualified with a namespace using the scope resolution operator (::).  For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">std::cout // identifier cout is qualified by namespace std
::foo // identifier foo is qualified by the global namespace</code></pre>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    For advanced readers
   </p>
   <p>
    A name can also be qualified by a class name using the scope resolution operator (::), or by a class object using the member selection operators (. or -&gt;).  For example:
   </p>
   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">class C; // some class

C::s_member; // s_member is qualified by class C
obj.x; // x is qualified by class object obj
ptr-&gt;y; // y is qualified by pointer to class object ptr</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
   An
   <strong>
    unqualified name
   </strong>
   is a name that does not include a scoping qualifier.  For example,
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   are unqualified names, as they do not include an associated scope.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Using-declarations
  </p>
  <p>
   One way to reduce the repetition of typing
   <code>
    std::
   </code>
   over and over is to utilize a using-declaration statement.  A
   <strong>
    using declaration
   </strong>
   allows us to use an unqualified name (with no scope) as an alias for a qualified name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s our basic Hello world program, using a using-declaration on line 5:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
   using std::cout; // this using declaration tells the compiler that cout should resolve to std::cout
   cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here!

   return 0;
} // the using declaration expires at the end of the current scope</code></pre>
  <p>
   The using-declaration
   <code>
    using std::cout;
   </code>
   tells the compiler that we’re going to be using the object
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   from the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace.  So whenever it sees
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   , it will assume that we mean
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   .  If there’s a naming conflict between
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   and some other use of
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   will be preferred.  Therefore on line 6, we can type
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   instead of
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   This doesn’t save much effort in this trivial example, but if you are using
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   many times inside of a function, a using-declaration can make your code more readable.  Note that you will need a separate using-declaration for each name (e.g. one for
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   , one for
   <code>
    std::cin
   </code>
   , etc…).
  </p>
  <p>
   The using-declaration is active from the point of declaration to the end of the scope in which it is declared.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although using-declarations are less explicit than using the
   <code>
    std::
   </code>
   prefix, they are generally considered safe and acceptable to use in source (.cpp) files, after the #includes (particularly inside functions).

    Warning
   </p>
   <p>
    Avoid using-declarations in header files.
   </p>
   <p>
    In
    <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/053.htm">
     this article
    </a>
    , Herb Sutter says “the meaning of a using declaration in a header can change -- even when the using declaration is inside a namespace, and not at file scope -- depending on what else a client module may happen to #include before it.”
   </p>
  </div>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Using-directives
  </p>
  <p>
   Another way to simplify things is to use a using-directive.  A
   <strong>
    using directive
   </strong>
   allows
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   identifiers in a given namespace to be referenced without qualification from the scope of the using-directive.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    For advanced readers
   </p>
   <p>
    For technical reasons, using-directives do not actually introduce new meanings for names into the current scope -- instead they introduce new meanings for names into an outer scope (more details about which outer scope is picked can be found
    <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/21/using-directive/">
     here
    </a>
    ).
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Here’s our Hello world program again, with a using-directive on line 5:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
   using namespace std; // all names from std namespace now accessible without qualification
   cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here

   return 0;
} // the using-directive ends at the end of the current scope</code></pre>
  <p>
   The using-directive
   <code>
    using namespace std;
   </code>
   tells the compiler that all of the names in the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace should be accessible without qualification in the current scope (in this case, of function
   <code>
    main()
   </code>
   ).  When we then use unqualified identifier
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   , it will resolve to
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Using-directives are the solution that was provided for old pre-namespace codebases that used unqualified names for standard library functionality.  Rather than having to manually update every unqualified name to a qualified name (which was risky), a single using-directive (
   <code>
    using namespace std;
   </code>
   ) could be placed at the top of each file, and all of the names that had been moved to the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace could still be used unqualified.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">

   </a>
   Problems with using-directives (a.k.a. why you should avoid “using namespace std;”)
   <a href="#avoidUsingNamespace">
    <i class="fa fa-link" style="font-size: 0.8em;">
    </i>
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   In modern C++, using-directives generally offer little benefit (saving some typing) compared to the risk.  This is due to two factors:
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
   <li>
    Using-directives allow unqualified access to
    <em>
     all
    </em>
    of the names from a namespace (potentially including lots of names you’ll never use).
   </li>
   <li>
    Using-directives do not prefer names from the namespace of the using-directive over other names.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   The end result is that the possibility for naming collisions to occur increases significantly (especially if you import the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace).
  </p>
  <p>
   For illustrative purposes, let’s take a look at an example where using-directives cause ambiguity:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

namespace a
{
	int x{ 10 };
}

namespace b
{
	int x{ 20 };
}

int main()
{
	using namespace a;
	using namespace b;

	std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\n';

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example, the compiler is unable to determine whether the
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   in
   <code>
    main
   </code>
   refers to
   <code>
    a::x
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    b::x
   </code>
   .  In this case, it will fail to compile with an “ambiguous symbol” error.  We could resolve this by removing one of the using-statements, employing a using-declaration instead, or qualifying
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   with an explicit scope qualifier (
   <code>
    a::
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    b::
   </code>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s another more subtle example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt; // imports the declaration of std::cout

int cout() // declares our own "cout" function
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    using namespace std; // makes std::cout accessible as "cout"
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n"; // uh oh!  Which cout do we want here?  The one in the std namespace or the one we defined above?

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example, the compiler is unable to determine whether our unqualified use of
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   means
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   or the
   <code>
    cout
   </code>
   function we’ve defined, and again will fail to compile with an “ambiguous symbol” error.  Although this example is trivial, if we had explicitly prefixed
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n"; // tell the compiler we mean std::cout</code></pre>
  <p>
   or used a using-declaration instead of a using-directive:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">    using std::cout; // tell the compiler that cout means std::cout
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n"; // so this means std::cout</code></pre>
  <p>
   then our program wouldn’t have any issues in the first place.  And while you’re probably not likely to write a function named “cout”, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other names in the
   <code>
    std
   </code>
   namespace just waiting to collide with your names. “count”, “min”, “max”, “search”, “sort”, just to name a few.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if a using-directive does not cause naming collisions today, it makes your code more vulnerable to future collisions.  For example, if your code includes a using-directive for some library that is then updated, all of the new names introduced in the updated library are now candidates for naming collisions with your existing code.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a more insidious problem that can occur as well.  The updated library may introduce a function that not only has the same name, but is actually a better match for some function call.  In such a case, the compiler may decide to prefer the new function instead, and the behavior of your program will change unexpectedly and silently.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider the following program:
  </p>
  <p>
   foolib.h (part of some third-party library):
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#ifndef FOOLIB_H
#define FOOLIB_H

namespace Foo
{
    // pretend there is some useful code that we use here
}
#endif</code></pre>
  <p>
   main.cpp:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;foolib.h&gt; // a third-party library, thus angled brackets used

int someFcn(double)
{
    return 1;
}

int main()
{
    using namespace Foo; // Because we're lazy and want to access Foo:: qualified names without typing the Foo:: prefix
    std::cout &lt;&lt; someFcn(0) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // The literal 0 should be 0.0, but this is an easy mistake to make

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This program runs and prints
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, let’s say we update the foolib library, which includes an updated foolib.h.  Our program now looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   foolib.h (part of some third-party library):
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#ifndef FOOLIB_H
#define FOOLIB_H

namespace Foo
{
    // newly introduced function
    int someFcn(int)
    {
        return 2;
    }

    // pretend there is some useful code that we use here
}
#endif</code></pre>
  <p>
   main.cpp:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;foolib.h&gt;

int someFcn(double)
{
    return 1;
}

int main()
{
    using namespace Foo; // Because we're lazy and want to access Foo:: qualified names without typing the Foo:: prefix
    std::cout &lt;&lt; someFcn(0) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // The literal 0 should be 0.0, but this is an easy mistake to make

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Our
   <code>
    main.cpp
   </code>
   file hasn’t changed at all, but this program now runs and prints
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   !
  </p>
  <p>
   When the compiler encounters a function call, it has to determine what function definition it should match the function call with.  In selecting a function from a set of potentially matching functions, it will prefer a function that requires no argument conversions over a function that requires argument conversions.  Because the literal
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   is an integer, C++ will prefer to match
   <code>
    someFcn(0)
   </code>
   with the newly introduced
   <code>
    someFcn(int)
   </code>
   (no conversions) over
   <code>
    someFcn(double)
   </code>
   (requires a conversion from int to double).  That causes an unexpected change to our program results.
  </p>
  <p>
   This would not have happened if we’d used a using-declaration or explicit scope qualifier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the lack of explicit scope prefixes make it harder for a reader to tell what functions are part of a library and what’s part of your program.  For example, if we use a using-directive:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">using namespace ns;

int main()
{
    foo(); // is this foo a user-defined function, or part of the ns library?
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   It’s unclear whether the call to
   <code>
    foo()
   </code>
   is actually a call to
   <code>
    ns::foo()
   </code>
   or to a
   <code>
    foo()
   </code>
   that is a user-defined function.  Modern IDEs should be able to disambiguate this for you when you hover over a name, but having to hover over each name just to see where it comes from is tedious.
  </p>
  <p>
   Without the using-directive, it’s much clearer:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    ns::foo(); // clearly part of the ns library
    foo(); // likely a user-defined function
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In this version, the call to
   <code>
    ns::foo()
   </code>
   is clearly a library call.  The call to plain
   <code>
    foo()
   </code>
   is probably a call to a user-defined function (some libraries, including certain standard library headers, do put names into the global namespace, so it’s not a guarantee).
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   The scope of using-declarations and using-directives
  </p>
  <p>
   If a using-declaration or using-directive is used within a block, the names are applicable to just that block (it follows normal block scoping rules).  This is a good thing, as it reduces the chances for naming collisions to occur to just within that block.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a using-declaration or using-directive is used in the global namespace, the names are applicable to the entire rest of the file (they have file scope).
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Cancelling or replacing a using-statement
  </p>
  <p>
   Once a using-statement has been declared, there’s no way to cancel or replace it with a different using-statement within the scope in which it was declared.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    using namespace Foo;

    // there's no way to cancel the "using namespace Foo" here!
    // there's also no way to replace "using namespace Foo" with a different using statement

    return 0;
} // using namespace Foo ends here</code></pre>
  <p>
   The best you can do is intentionally limit the scope of the using-statement from the outset using the block scoping rules.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    {
        using namespace Foo;
        // calls to Foo:: stuff here
    } // using namespace Foo expires
 
    {
        using namespace Goo;
        // calls to Goo:: stuff here
    } // using namespace Goo expires

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   Of course, all of this headache can be avoided by explicitly using the scope resolution operator (::) in the first place.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Best practices for using-statements

  <p>
   Avoid using-directives (particularly
   <code>

   ) altogether, except in specific circumstances (such as
   <code>
