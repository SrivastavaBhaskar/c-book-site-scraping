   , we introduced
   <code>
    local variables
   </code>
   , which are variables that are defined inside a function (including function parameters).
   <p>
    It turns out that C++ actually doesn’t have a single attribute that defines a variable as being a local variable. Instead, local variables have several different properties that differentiate how these variables behave from other kinds of (non-local) variables. We’ll explore these properties in this and upcoming lessons.

     , we also introduced the concept of scope. An identifier’s
     <code>
      scope
     </code>
     determines where an identifier can be accessed within the source code. When an identifier can be accessed, we say it is
     <code>
      in scope
     </code>
     . When an identifier can not be accessed, we say it is
     <code>
      out of scope
     </code>
     . Scope is a compile-time property, and trying to use an identifier when it is out of scope will result in a compile error.

       Local variables have

        block scope

       , which means they are
       <em>

       from their point of definition to the end of the block they are defined within.

        Although function parameters are not defined inside the function body, for typical functions they can be considered to be part of the scope of the function body block.

         All variable names within a scope must be unique
         <p>
          Variable names must be unique within a given scope, otherwise any reference to the name will be ambiguous. Consider the following program:
          <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">void someFunction(int x)

          <p>
           The above program doesn’t compile because the variable
           <code>

           </code>
           defined inside the function body and the function parameter

            Local variables have automatic storage duration

             A variable’s

              storage duration

             <code>
              lifetime

             <p>
              For example, local variables have
              <strong>
               automatic storage duration
              </strong>
              , which means they are created at the point of definition and destroyed at the end of the block they are defined in. For example:
              <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    int i { 5 }; // i created and initialized here
    double d { 4.0 }; // d created and initialized here

    return 0;
} // d and i are destroyed here</code></pre>
              <p>
               For this reason, local variables are sometimes called
               <strong>
                automatic variables

                Local variables in nested blocks
                <p>
                 Local variables can be defined inside nested blocks. This works identically to local variables in function body blocks:
                 <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main() // outer block
{
    int x { 5 }; // x enters scope and is created here

    { // nested block
        int y { 7 }; // y enters scope and is created here
    } // y goes out of scope and is destroyed here

    // y can not be used here because it is out of scope in this block

    return 0;
} // x goes out of scope and is destroyed here</code></pre>
                 <p>
                  In the above example, variable
                  <code>
                   y
                  </code>
                  is defined inside a nested block. Its scope is limited from its point of definition to the end of the nested block, and its lifetime is the same. Because the scope of variable
                  <code>
                   y
                  </code>
                  is limited to the inner block in which it is defined, it’s not accessible anywhere in the outer block.
                  <p>
                   Note that nested blocks are considered part of the scope of the outer block in which they are defined. Consequently, variables defined in the outer block
                   <em>
                    can
                   </em>
                   be seen inside a nested block:
                   <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{ // outer block

    int x { 5 }; // x enters scope and is created here

    { // nested block
        int y { 7 }; // y enters scope and is created here

        // x and y are both in scope here
        std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " + " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; x + y &lt;&lt; '\n';

    // y can not be used here because it is out of scope in this block

                    Local variables have no linkage

                     </strong>
                     determines whether a declaration of that same identifier in a different scope refers to the same object (or function).
                     <p>
                      Local variables have no linkage. Each declaration of an identifier with no linkage refers to a unique object or function.
                      <p>
                       For example:
                       <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int main()
{
    int x { 2 }; // local variable, no linkage

    {
        int x { 3 }; // this declaration of x refers to a different object than the previous x
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                       <p>
                        Scope and linkage may seem somewhat similar. However, scope determines where declaration of a single identifier can be seen and used in the code. Linkage determines whether multiple declarations of the same identifier refer to the same object or not.

                          Variables should be defined in the most limited scope
                          <p>
                           If a variable is only used within a nested block, it should be defined inside that nested block:
                           <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

        int y { 5 };
        std::cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    // otherwise y could still be used here, where it's not needed

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                           <p>
                            By limiting the scope of a variable, you reduce the complexity of the program because the number of active variables is reduced. Further, it makes it easier to see where variables are used (or aren’t used). A variable defined inside a block can only be used within that block (or nested blocks). This can make the program easier to understand.
                            <p>
                             If a variable is needed in an outer block, it needs to be declared in the outer block:
                             <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    int y { 5 }; // we're declaring y here because we need it in this outer block later

    {
        int x{};
        std::cin &gt;&gt; x;

        // if we declared y here, immediately before its actual first use...
        if (x == 4)
            y = 4;
    } // ... it would be destroyed here

    std::cout &lt;&lt; y; // and we need y to exist here

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                             <p>
                              The above example shows one of the rare cases where you may need to declare a variable well before its first use.
                              <p>
                               New developers sometimes wonder whether it’s worth creating a nested block just to intentionally limit a variable’s scope (and force it to go out of scope / be destroyed early). Doing so makes that variable simpler, but the overall function becomes longer and more complex as a result. The tradeoff generally isn’t worth it. If creating a nested block seems useful to intentionally limit the scope of a chunk of code, that code might be better to put in a separate function instead.

                                       header to swap the values of two variables. For example
                                       <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int temp{ larger };
larger = smaller;
smaller = temp;

// is the same as
std::swap(larger, smaller);</code></pre>

                                  Question #2
                                  <p>
                                   What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and lifetime? By default, what kind of scope and duration do local variables have (and what do those mean)?
                                   <p>
                                    <a class="solution_link_show" href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_1'),this,'Show Solution','Hide Solution')">
                                     Show Solution
                                    </a>

                                      A variable’s scope determines where the variable is accessible within the source code. Duration defines the rules that govern when a variable is created and destroyed. A variable’s lifetime is the actual time between its creation and destruction.
                                      <p>
                                       Local variables have block scope, which means they can be accessed from their point of definition to the end of the block they are defined within.
                                       <p>
                                        Local variables have automatic duration, which means they are created at the point of definition, and destroyed at the end of the block in which they are defined.
