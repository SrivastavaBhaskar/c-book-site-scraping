   Chapter Review
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Scope creep
   </strong>
   occurs when a project’s capabilities grow beyond what was originally intended at the start of the project or project phase.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Software verification
   </strong>
   is the process of testing whether or not the software works as expected in all cases.  A
   <strong>
    unit test
   </strong>
   is a test designed to test a small portion of the code (typically a function or call) in isolation to ensure a particular behavior occurs as expected.
   <strong>
    Unit test frameworks
   </strong>
   can help you organize your unit tests.
   <strong>
    Integration testing
   </strong>
   tests the integration of a bunch of units together to ensure they work properly.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Code coverage
   </strong>
   refers to how much of the source code is executed while testing.
   <strong>
    Statement coverage
   </strong>
   refers to the percentage of statements in a program that have been exercised by testing routines.
   <strong>
    Branch coverage
   </strong>
   refers to the percentage of branches that have been executed by testing routines.
   <strong>
    Loop coverage
   </strong>
   (also called the
   <strong>
    0, 1, 2 test
   </strong>
   ) means that if you have a loop, you should ensure it works properly when it iterates 0 times, 1 time, and 2 times.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    happy path
   </strong>
   is the path of execution that occurs when there are no errors encountered.  A
   <strong>
    sad path
   </strong>
   is one where an error or failure state occurs.  A
   <strong>
    non-recoverable error
   </strong>
   (also called a
   <strong>
    fatal error
   </strong>
   ) is an error that is severe enough that the program can’t continue running.  A program that handles error cases well is
   <strong>
    robust
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <strong>
    buffer
   </strong>
   is a piece of memory set aside for storing data temporarily while it is moved from one place to another.
  </p>
  <p>
   The process of checking whether user input conforms to what the program is expecting is called
   <strong>
    input validation
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    std::cerr
   </strong>
   is an output stream (like
   <code>
    std::cout
   </code>
   ) designed to be used for error messages.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <strong>
    precondition
   </strong>
   is any condition that must always be true prior to the execution of some segment of code.  An
   <strong>
    invariant
   </strong>
   is a condition that must be true while some component is executing.  A
   <strong>
    postcondition
   </strong>
   is any condition that must always be true after the execution of some code.
  </p>
  <p>
   An
   <strong>
    assertion
   </strong>
   is an expression that will be true unless there is a bug in the program.  In C++, runtime assertions are typically implemented using the
   <strong>
    assert
   </strong>
   preprocessor macro.  Assertions are usually turned off in non-debug code.  A
   <strong>
    static_assert
   </strong>
   is an assertion that is evaluated at compile-time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assertions should be used to document cases that should be logically impossible.  Error handling should be used to handle cases that are possible.

   Question #1
  </p>
  <p>
   In a quiz for lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-8-summary-and-quiz/">
    8.x -- Chapter 8 summary and quiz
   </a>
   , we implemented a game of Hi-Lo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Update your previous solution to handle invalid guesses (e.g. ‘x’), out of bounds guesses (e.g.
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    101
   </code>
   ), or valid guesses that have extraneous characters (e.g.
   <code>
    43x
   </code>
   ).  Also handle the user entering extra characters when the game asks them whether they want to play again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hint: Write a separate function to handle the user inputting their guess (along with the associated error handling).
