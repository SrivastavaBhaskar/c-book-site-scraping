   Constexpr function calls in non-required constant expressions
  </p>
  <p>
   You might expect that a constexpr function would evaluate at compile-time whenever possible, but unfortunately this is not the case.
  </p>
  <p>
   In lesson
   <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constant-expressions/">
    5.5 -- Constant expressions
   </a>
   , we noted that in contexts that do not
   <em>
    require
   </em>
   a constant expression, the compiler may choose whether to evaluate a constant expression at either compile-time or at runtime.  Accordingly, any constexpr function call that is part of a non-required constant expression may be evaluated at either compile-time or runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

constexpr int getValue(int x)
{
    return x;
}

int main()
{
    int x { getValue(5) }; // may evaluate at runtime or compile-time
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example, because
   <code>
    getValue()
   </code>
   is constexpr, the call
   <code>
    getValue(5)
   </code>
   is a constant expression.  However, because variable
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   is not constexpr, it does not require a constant expression initializer.  So even though we’ve provided a constant expression initializer, the compiler is free to choose whether
   <code>
    getValue(5)
   </code>
   evaluates at runtime or compile-time.

    Compile-time evaluation of constexpr functions is only guaranteed when a constant expression is required.

   Diagnosis of constexpr functions
  </p>
  <p>
   The compiler is
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   required to determine whether a constexpr function is evaluatable at compile-time until it is actually evaluated at compile-time.  It is fairly easy to write a constexpr function that compiles successfully for runtime use, but then fails to compile when evaluated at compile-time.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a silly example of this:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int getValue(int x)
{
    return x;
}

// This function can be evaluated at runtime
// When evaluated at compile-time, the function will produce a compilation error
// because the call to getValue(x) cannot be resolved at compile-time
constexpr int foo(int x)
{
    if (x &lt; 0) return 0; // needed prior to adoption of P2448R1 in C++23 (see note below)
    return getValue(x);  // call to non-constexpr function here
}

int main()
{
    int x { foo(5) };           // okay: will evaluate at runtime
    constexpr int y { foo(5) }; // compile error: foo(5) can't evaluate at compile-time

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example, when
   <code>
    foo(5)
   </code>
   is used as an initializer for non-constexpr variable
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   , it will be evaluated at runtime.  This works fine, and returns the value
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   However, when
   <code>
    foo(5)
   </code>
   , is used as an initializer for constexpr variable
   <code>
    y
   </code>
   , it must be evaluated at compile-time.  At that point, the compiler will determine that the call to
   <code>
    foo(5)
   </code>
   can’t be evaluated at compile-time, as
   <code>
    getValue()
   </code>
   is not a constexpr function.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, when writing a constexpr function, always explicitly test that it compiles when evaluated at compile-time (by calling it in a context where a constant expression is required, such as in the initialization of a constexpr variable).

    Prior to C++23, if no argument values exist that would allow a constexpr function to be evaluated at compile-time, the program is ill-formed (no diagnostic required).  Without the line
    <code>
     if (x &lt; 0) return 0
    </code>
    , the above example would contain no set of arguments that allow the function to be evaluatable at compile-time, making the program ill-formed.  Given that no diagnostic is required, the compiler may not enforce this.
   </p>
   <p>
    This requirement was revoked in C++23 (

    A constexpr function parameter would imply the function could only be called with a constexpr argument.  But this is not the case -- constexpr functions can be called with non-constexpr arguments when the function is evaluated at runtime.

  <p>
   Because such parameters are not constexpr, they cannot be used in constant expressions within the function.

   Constexpr functions are implicitly inline
  </p>
  <p>
   When a constexpr function is evaluated at compile-time, the compiler must be able to see the full definition of the constexpr function prior to such function calls (so it can perform the evaluation itself).  A forward declaration will not suffice in this case, even if the actual function definition appears later in the same compilation unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   This means that a constexpr function called in multiple files needs to have its definition included into each translation unit -- which would normally be a violation of the one-definition rule.  To avoid such problems, constexpr functions are implicitly inline, which makes them exempt from the one-definition rule.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result, constexpr functions are often defined in header files, so they can be #included into any .cpp file that requires the full definition.

   For constexpr function calls that are only evaluated at runtime, a forward declaration is sufficient to satisfy the compiler.

    , the actual requirement for the forward declaration of constexpr functions that are evaluated at compile-time is that “the constexpr function must be defined prior to the outermost evaluation that eventually results in the invocation”.  Therefore, this is allowed:

   Recap
  </p>
  <p>
   Marking a function as
   <code>
    constexpr
   </code>
   means it can be used in a constant expression.  It does not mean “will evaluate at compile-time”.
  </p>
  <p>
   A constant expression (which may contain constexpr function calls) is only required to evaluate at compile-time in contexts where a constant expression is required.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contexts that do not require a constant expression, the compiler may choose whether to evaluate a constant expression (which may contain constexpr function calls) at compile-time or at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
   A runtime (non-constant) expression (which may contain constexpr function calls or non-constexpr function calls) will evaluate at runtime.

   Another example
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s do another examine to explore how a constexpr function is required or likely to evaluate further:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

constexpr int greater(int x, int y)
{
    return (x &gt; y ? x : y);
}

int main()
{
    constexpr int g { greater(5, 6) };              // case 1: always evaluated at compile-time
    std::cout &lt;&lt; g &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n";

    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(5, 6) &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n"; // case 2: may be evaluated at either runtime or compile-time

    int x{ 5 }; // not constexpr but value is known at compile-time
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(x, 6) &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n"; // case 3: likely evaluated at runtime

    std::cin &gt;&gt; x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(x, 6) &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n"; // case 4: always evaluated at runtime

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In case 1, we’re calling
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   in a context that requires a constant expression.  Thus
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   must be evaluated at compile-time.
  </p>
  <p>
   In case 2, the
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   function is being called in a context that does not require a constant expression, as output statements must execute at runtime.  However, since the arguments are constant expressions, the function is eligible to be evaluated at compile-time.  Thus the compiler is free to choose whether this call to
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   will be evaluated at compile-time or runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
   In case 3, we’re calling
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   with one argument that is not a constant expression.  So this will typically execute at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, this argument has a value that is known at compile-time.  Under the as-if rule, the compiler could decide to treat the evaluation of
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   as a constant expression, and evaluate this call to
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   at compile-time.  But more likely, it will evaluate it at runtime.

   <p>
    Note that even non-constexpr functions could be evaluated at compile-time under the as-if rule!
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   In case 4, the value of argument
   <code>
    x
   </code>
   can’t be known at compile-time, so this call to
   <code>

   will always evaluate at runtime.

    Key insight
   </p>
   <p>
    Put another way, we can categorize the likelihood that a function will actually be evaluated at compile-time as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    Always (required by the standard):
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Constexpr function is called where constant expression is required.
    </li>
    <li>
     Constexpr function is called from other function being evaluated at compile-time.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Probably (there’s little reason not to):
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Constexpr function is called where constant expression isn’t required, all arguments are constant expressions.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Possibly (if optimized under the as-if rule):
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Constexpr function is called where constant expression isn’t required, some arguments are not constant expressions but their values are known at compile-time.
    </li>
    <li>
     Non-constexpr function capable of being evaluated at compile-time, all arguments are constant expressions.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Never (not possible):
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Constexpr function is called where constant expression isn’t required, some arguments have values that are not known at compile-time.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
   Note that your compiler’s optimization level setting may have an impact on whether it decides to evaluate a function at compile-time or runtime.  This also means that your compiler may make different choices for debug vs. release builds (as debug builds typically have optimizations turned off).
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, both gcc and Clang will not compile-time evaluate a constexpr function called where a constant expression isn’t required unless the compiler told to optimize the code (e.g. using the
   <code>
    -O2
   </code>
   compiler option).

  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    For advanced readers
   </p>
   <p>
    The compiler might also choose to inline a function call, or even optimize a function call away entirely.  Both of these can affect when (or if) the content of the function call are evaluated.
