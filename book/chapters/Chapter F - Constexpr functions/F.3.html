   Forcing a constexpr function to be evaluated at compile-time
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no way to tell the compiler that a constexpr function should prefer to evaluate at compile-time whenever it can (e.g. in cases where the return value of a constexpr function is used in a non-constant expression).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, we can force a constexpr function that is eligible to be evaluated at compile-time to actually evaluate at compile-time by ensuring the return value is used where a constant expression is required.  This needs to be done on a per-call basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most common way to do this is to use the return value to initialize a constexpr variable (this is why we’ve been using variable ‘g’ in prior examples).  Unfortunately, this requires introducing a new variable into our program just to ensure compile-time evaluation, which is ugly and reduces code readability.

    There are several hacky ways that people have tried to work around the problem of having to introduce a new constexpr variable each time we want to force compile-time evaluation.  See

   However, in C++20, there is a better workaround to this issue, which we’ll present in a moment.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Consteval
  </p>
  <p>
   C++20 introduces the keyword
   <strong>
    consteval
   </strong>
   , which is used to indicate that a function
   <em>
    must
   </em>
   evaluate at compile-time, otherwise a compile error will result.  Such functions are called
   <strong>
    immediate functions
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

consteval int greater(int x, int y) // function is now consteval
{
    return (x &gt; y ? x : y);
}

int main()
{
    constexpr int g { greater(5, 6) };              // ok: will evaluate at compile-time
    std::cout &lt;&lt; g &lt;&lt; '\n';

    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(5, 6) &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n"; // ok: will evaluate at compile-time

    int x{ 5 }; // not constexpr
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(x, 6) &lt;&lt; " is greater!\n"; // error: consteval functions must evaluate at compile-time

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   In the above example, the first two calls to
   <code>
    greater()
   </code>
   will evaluate at compile-time.  The call to
   <code>
    greater(x, 6)
   </code>
   cannot be evaluated at compile-time, so a compile error will result.
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground">
   <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Best practice
   </p>
   <p>
    Use
    <code>
     consteval
    </code>
    if you have a function that must evaluate at compile-time for some reason (e.g. because it does something that can only be done at compile time).
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Perhaps surprisingly, the parameters of a consteval function are not constexpr (even though consteval functions can only be evaluated at compile-time).  This decision was made for the sake of consistency.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   Using consteval to make constexpr execute at compile-time
  </p>
  <p>
   The downside of consteval functions is that such functions can’t evaluate at runtime, making them less flexible than constexpr functions, which can do either.  Therefore, it would still be useful to have a convenient way to force constexpr functions to evaluate at compile-time (even when the return value is being used where a constant expression is not required), so that we could have compile-time evaluation when possible, and runtime evaluation when we can’t.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consteval functions provides a way to make this happen, using a neat helper function:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// Uses abbreviated function template (C++20) and `auto` return type to make this function work with any type of value
// See 'related content' box below for more info (you don't need to know how these work to use this function)
consteval auto compileTimeEval(auto value)
{
    return value;
}

constexpr int greater(int x, int y) // function is constexpr
{
    return (x &gt; y ? x : y);
}

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(5, 6) &lt;&lt; '\n';                  // may or may not execute at compile-time
    std::cout &lt;&lt; compileTimeEval(greater(5, 6)) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // will execute at compile-time

    int x { 5 };
    std::cout &lt;&lt; greater(x, 6) &lt;&lt; '\n';                  // we can still call the constexpr version at runtime if we wish

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   This works because consteval functions require constant expressions as arguments -- therefore, if we use the return value of a constexpr function as an argument to a consteval function, the constexpr function must be evaluated at compile-time!  The consteval function just returns this argument as its own return value, so the caller can still use it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that the consteval function returns by value.  While this might be inefficient to do at runtime (if the value was some type that is expensive to copy, e.g. std::string), in a compile-time context, it doesn’t matter because the entire call to the consteval function will simply be replaced with the calculated return value.

   Determining if a constexpr function call is evaluating at compile-time or runtime
  </p>
  <p>
   C++ does not currently provide any reliable mechanisms to do this.
  </p>
  <p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear: both">
   What about
   <code>
    std::is_constant_evaluated
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    if consteval
   </code>
   ?
  </p>
  <p>
   Neither of these capabilities tell you whether a function call is evaluating at compile-time or runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>
    std::is_constant_evaluated()
   </code>
   (defined in the &lt;type_traits&gt; header) returns a
   <code>
    bool
   </code>
   indicating whether the current function is executing in a constant-evaluated context.  A
   <strong>
    constant-evaluated context
   </strong>
   (also called a
   <strong>
    constant context
   </strong>
   ) is defined as one in which a constant expression is required (such as the initialization of a constexpr variable).  So in cases where the compiler is required to evaluate a constant expression at compile-time
   <code>
    std::is_constant_evaluated()
   </code>
   will
   <code>
    true
   </code>
   as expected.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is intended to allow you to do something like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;type_traits&gt; // for std::is_constant_evaluated()

constexpr int someFunction()
{
    if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) // if evaluating in constant context
        doSomething();
    else
        doSomethingElse();
}</code></pre>
  <p>
   However, the compiler may also choose to evaluate a constexpr function at compile-time in a context that does not require a constant expression.  In such cases,
   <code>
    std::is_constant_evaluated()
   </code>
   will return
   <code>
    false
   </code>
   even though the function did evaluate at compile-time.  So
   <code>
    std::is_constant_evaluated()
   </code>
   really means “the compiler is being forced to evaluate this at compile-time”, not “this is evaluating at compile-time”.

    Key insight
   </p>
   <p>
    While this may seem strange, there are several reasons for this:
   </p>
   <ol start="1">
    <li>
     As
     <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0595r2.html">
      the paper that proposed this feature
     </a>
     indicates, the standard doesn’t actually make a distinction between “compile time” and “runtime”.  Defining behavior involving that distinction would have been a larger change.
    </li>
    <li>
     Optimizations should not change the observable behavior of a program (unless explicitly allowed by the standard).  If
     <code>
      std::is_constant_evaluated()
     </code>
     were to return
     <code>
      true
     </code>
     when the function was evaluated at compile-time for any reason, then the optimizer deciding to evaluate a function at compile-time instead of runtime could potentially change the observable behavior of the function.  As a result, your program might behave very differently depending on what optimization level it was compiled with!
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    While this could be addressed in various ways, those involve adding additional complexity to the optimizer and/or limiting its ability to optimize certain cases.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   Introduced in C++23,
   <code>
    if consteval
   </code>
   is a replacement for
   <code>
    if (std::is_constant_evaluated())
   </code>
   that provides a nicer syntax and fixes some other issues.  However, it evaluates the same way.
