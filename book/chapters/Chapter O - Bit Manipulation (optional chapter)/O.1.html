   On modern computer architectures, the smallest addressable unit of memory is a byte. Since all objects need to have unique memory addresses, this means objects must be at least one byte in size. For most variable types, this is fine. However, for Boolean values, this is a bit wasteful (pun intended). Boolean types only have two states: true (1), or false (0). This set of states only requires one bit to store. However, if a variable must be at least a byte, and a byte is 8 bits, that means a Boolean is using 1 bit and leaving the other 7 unused.
   <p>
    In the majority of cases, this is fine -- we’re usually not so hard-up for memory that we need to care about 7 wasted bits (we’re better off optimizing for understandability and maintainability). However, in some storage-intensive cases, it can be useful to “pack” 8 individual Boolean values into a single byte for storage efficiency purposes.
    <p>
     Doing these things requires that we can manipulate objects at the bit level. Fortunately, C++ gives us tools to do precisely this. Modifying individual bits within an object is called
     <strong>
      bit manipulation
     </strong>
     .

       Author’s note
       <p>
        Bit manipulation is used a lot in certain programming contexts (e.g. graphics, encryption, compression, optimization), but not as much in general programming.
        <p>
         Because of that, this entire chapter is optional reading. Feel free to skip or skim it and come back later.

      Bit flags
      <p>
       Up to this point, we’ve used variables to hold single values:
       <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">int foo { 5 }; // assign foo the value 5 (probably uses 32 bits of storage)
std::cout &lt;&lt; foo; // print the value 5</code></pre>
       <p>
        However, instead of viewing objects as holding a single value, we can instead view them as a collection of individual bits. When individual bits of an object are used as Boolean values, the bits are called
        <strong>
         bit flags
        </strong>
        .
        <div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground">
         <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
          As an aside…
          <p>
           In computing, a
           <strong>
            flag
           </strong>
           is a value that signals when some condition exists in a program. With a bit flag, a value of
           <code>
            true
           </code>
           means the condition exists.
           <p>
            Analogously, in the United States, many mailboxes have small (usually red) physical flags attached to the side. When outgoing mail is waiting to be picked up by the carrier, the flag is raised to signal that there is outgoing mail.
           </p>
          </p>
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         To define a set of bit flags, we’ll typically use an unsigned integer of the appropriate size (8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, etc… depending on how many flags we have), or std::bitset.
         <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;bitset&gt; // for std::bitset

std::bitset&lt;8&gt; mybitset {}; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags</code></pre>

           Best practice
           <p>
            Bit manipulation is one of the few times when you should unambiguously use unsigned integers (or std::bitset).

          In this lesson, we’ll show how to do bit manipulation the easy way, via std::bitset. In the next set of lessons, we’ll explore how to do it the more difficult but versatile way.

           Bit numbering and bit positions
           <p>
            Given a sequence of bits, we typically number the bits from right to left, starting with 0 (not 1). Each number denotes a
            <strong>
             bit position
            </strong>
            .
            <pre>76543210  Bit position
00000101  Bit sequence
</pre>
            <p>
             Given the bit sequence 0000 0101, the bits that are in position 0 and 2 have value 1, and the other bits have value 0.

               we already showed how to use a std::bitset to print values in binary. However, this isn’t the only useful thing std::bitset can do.
               <p>
                std::bitset provides 4 key member functions that are useful for doing bit manipulation:
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  test() allows us to query whether a bit is a 0 or 1.
                  <li>
                   set() allows us to turn a bit on (this will do nothing if the bit is already on).
                   <li>
                    reset() allows us to turn a bit off (this will do nothing if the bit is already off).
                    <li>
                     flip() allows us to flip a bit value from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa.
                    </li>
                   </li>
                  </li>
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 Each of these functions takes the position of the bit we want to operate on as their only argument.
                 <p>
                  Here’s an example:
                  <pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp match-braces">#include &lt;bitset&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::bitset&lt;8&gt; bits{ 0b0000'0101 }; // we need 8 bits, start with bit pattern 0000 0101
    bits.set(3);   // set bit position 3 to 1 (now we have 0000 1101)
    bits.flip(4);  // flip bit 4 (now we have 0001 1101)
    bits.reset(4); // set bit 4 back to 0 (now we have 0000 1101)

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "All the bits: " &lt;&lt; bits&lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Bit 3 has value: " &lt;&lt; bits.test(3) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Bit 4 has value: " &lt;&lt; bits.test(4) &lt;&lt; '\n';

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                   This prints:
                   <pre>All the bits: 00001101
Bit 3 has value: 1
Bit 4 has value: 0

                      std::bitset doesn’t make this easy. In order to do this, or if we want to use unsigned integer bit flags instead of std::bitset, we need to turn to more traditional methods. We’ll cover these in the next couple of lessons.

                       The size of std::bitset
                       <p>
                        One potential surprise is that std::bitset is optimized for speed, not memory savings. The size of a std::bitset is typically the number of bytes needed to hold the bits, rounded
                        <em>
                         up
                        </em>
                        to the nearest
                        <code>
                         sizeof(size_t)
                        </code>
                        , which is 4 bytes on 32-bit machines, and 8-bytes on 64-bit machines.
                        <p>
                         Thus, a
                         <code>
                          std::bitset&lt;8&gt;
                         </code>
                         will typically use either 4 or 8 bytes of memory, even though it technically only needs 1 byte to store 8 bits. Thus, std::bitset is most useful when we desire convenience, not memory savings.
