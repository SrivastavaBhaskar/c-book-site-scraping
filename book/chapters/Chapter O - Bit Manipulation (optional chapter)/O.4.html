   Consider a decimal integral value, such as 5623. We intuitively understand that these digits mean (5 * 1000) + (6 * 100) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 1). Because there are 10 decimal numbers, the value of each subsequent digit to the left increases by a factor of 10.
   <p>
    Binary numbers work the same way, except because there are only 2 binary digits (0 and 1), the value of each digit increases by a factor of 2. Just like commas are often used to make a large decimal number easy to read (e.g. 1,427,435), we often write binary numbers in groups of 4 bits to make them easier to read (e.g. 1101 0101).

       Converting binary to decimal
       <p>
        In the following examples, we assume that we’re dealing with unsigned integers.
        <p>
         Consider the 8 bit (1 byte) binary number 0101 1110. Binary 0101 1110 means (0 * 128) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1). If we sum up all of these parts, we get the decimal number 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 94.
         <p>
          Here is the same process in table format. We multiply each binary digit by its digit value (determined by its position). Summing up all these values gives us the total.

              This can easily be extended to 16 or 32 bit binary numbers simply by adding more columns. Note that it’s easiest to start on the right end, and work your way left, multiplying the digit value by 2 as you go.

               Method 1 for converting decimal to binary
               <p>
                Converting from decimal to binary is a little more tricky, but still pretty straightforward. There are a few good methods to do this.
                <p>
                 In this first method, you continually divide by 2, and write down the remainders. The binary number is constructed at the end from the remainders, from the bottom up.
                 <p>
                  Converting 148 from decimal to binary (using r to denote a remainder):
                  <p>
                   148 / 2 = 74 r0
                   <br/>
                   74 / 2 = 37 r0
                   <br/>
                   37 / 2 = 18 r1
                   <br/>
                   18 / 2 = 9 r0
                   <br/>
                   9 / 2 = 4 r1
                   <br/>
                   4 / 2 = 2 r0
                   <br/>
                   2 / 2 = 1 r0
                   <br/>
                   1 / 2 = 0 r1
                   <p>
                    Writing all of the remainders from the bottom up: 1001 0100
                    <p>
                     148 decimal = 1001 0100 binary.
                     <p>
                      You can verify this answer by converting the binary back to decimal:
                      <p>
                       (1 * 128) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 148
                       <p>
                        This method is the best for humans, as it only involves dividing by 2. It is less good for machines because it requires storing all of the bits as they are calculated so they can be printed in reverse order later.

                         Method 2 for converting decimal to binary
                         <p>
                          In the remaining two methods, we’ll work forwards, calculating each bit as we go, so that we don’t have to reconstruct the binary number at the end.
                          <p>
                           Consider the decimal number 148 again. The largest power of 2 that’s smaller than 148 is 128, so we’ll start there.
                           <p>
                            Is 148 &gt;= 128? Yes, so the 128 bit must be 1. 148 - 128 = 20, which means we need to find bits worth 20 more.
                            <br/>
                            Is 20 &gt;= 64? No, so the 64 bit must be 0.
                            <br/>
                            Is 20 &gt;= 32? No, so the 32 bit must be 0.
                            <br/>
                            Is 20 &gt;= 16? Yes, so the 16 bit must be 1. 20 - 16 = 4, which means we need to find bits worth 4 more.
                            <p>
                             Is 4 &gt;= 8? No, so the 8 bit must be 0.
                             <br/>
                             Is 4 &gt;= 4? Yes, so the 4 bit must be 1. 4 - 4 = 0, which means all the rest of the bits must be 0.
                             <p>
                              148 = (1 * 128) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 1001 0100

                                This method is pretty easy for humans when the numbers are small (e.g. for 8-bit binary numbers). It’s also pretty efficient for machines, since each bit requires a comparison, a subtraction, and an assignment.

                                 Method 3 for converting decimal to binary
                                 <p>
                                  This method is a variant of method 2 that uses integer division. Consider the decimal number 148 yet again. The largest power of 2 that’s smaller than 148 is 128, so we’ll start there.
                                  <p>
                                   148 / 128 = 1 with some remainder. Since 1 is odd, this bit is a 1.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 64 = 2 with some remainder. Since 2 is even, this bit is a 0.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 32 = 4 with some remainder. Since 4 is even, this bit is a 0.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 16 = 9 with some remainder. Since 9 is odd, this bit is a 1.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 8 = 18 with some remainder. Since 18 is even, this bit is a 0.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 4 = 37 with some remainder. Since 37 is odd, this bit is a 1.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 2 = 74 with some remainder. Since 74 is even, this bit is a 0.
                                   <br/>
                                   148 / 1 = 148 with some remainder. Since 148 is even, this bit is a 0.
                                   <p>
                                    148 = (1 * 128) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 1001 0100

                                     This method isn’t great for humans, as it requires a lot of division. It’s also less efficient for machines since division is an inefficient operation. But it is easy to write in code since it requires no if-statements.

                                                  Let’s add these. First, line them up, as we have above. Then, starting from the right and working left, we add each column of digits, just like we do in a decimal number. However, because a binary digit can only be a 0 or a 1, there are only 4 possibilities:
                                                  <ul>
                                                   <li>
                                                    0 + 0 = 0
                                                    <li>
                                                     0 + 1 = 1
                                                     <li>
                                                      1 + 0 = 1
                                                      <li>
                                                       1 + 1 = 0, carry a 1 over to the next column
                                                      </li>
                                                     </li>
                                                    </li>
                                                   </li>
                                                  </ul>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Let’s do the first column:
                                                   <pre>0110 (6 in decimal) +

                                                   <p>
                                                    0 + 1 = 1. Easy.
                                                    <p>
                                                     Second column:
                                                     <pre> 1
0110 (6 in decimal) +
0111 (7 in decimal)

</pre>
                                                     <p>
                                                      1 + 1 = 0, with a carried 1 into the next column
                                                      <p>
                                                       Third column:
                                                       <pre>11

                                                       <p>
                                                        This one is a little trickier. Normally, 1 + 1 = 0, with a carried one into the next column. However, we already have a 1 carried from the previous column, so we need to add 1. Thus, we end up with a 1 in this column, with a 1 carried over to the next column.
                                                        <p>
                                                         Last column:
                                                         <pre>11
0110 (6 in decimal) +
0111 (7 in decimal)

                                                         <p>
                                                          0 + 0 = 0, but there’s a carried 1, so we add 1. 1101 = 13 in decimal.
                                                          <p>
                                                           Now, how do we add 1 to any given binary number (such as 1011 0011)? The same as above, only the bottom number is binary 1.
                                                           <pre>      11  (carry column)

                                                              Signed integers are typically stored using a method known as

                                                                 <p>

                                                                  <p>

                                                                   <br/>

If a negative value was simply represented as the inverse of the positive number, 0 would have two representations: 0000 0000 (positive zero) and 1111 1111 (negative zero). By adding 1, 1111 1111 intentionally overflows and becomes 0000 0000. This prevents 0 from having two representations, and simplifies some of the internal logic needed to do arithmetic with negative numbers.

                                                                        <p>

                                                                         <p>

                                                                          <p>

                                                                           <p>

                                                                              <p>

                                                                               <p>
                                                                                However, if this value was stored using two’s complement, it would be -76.
                                                                                <p>
                                                                                 And if the value were encoded some other way, it could be something else entirely.
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  So how does C++ know whether to print a variable containing binary 1011 0100 as 180 or -76?
                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                   In case the section title didn’t give it away, this is where types come into play. The type of the variable determines both how a variable’s value is encoded into binary, and decoded back into a value. So if the variable type was an unsigned integer, it would know that 1011 0100 was standard binary, and should be printed as 180. If the variable was a signed integer, it would know that 1011 0100 was encoded using two’s complement (now guaranteed as of C++20), and should be printed as -76.
